      are not compatible for matrix-vector multiplication. Let''s analyze the runtime
      information:

      - The shape of the matrix (self) is [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9].

      - The shape of the vector (vec) is [9, 8, 1, 6, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8].


      In matrix-vector multiplication, the number of columns in the matrix should
      be equal to the length of the vector. Therefore, we need to ensure that the
      last dimension of the matrix is equal to the length of the vector.


      To prevent the error, we can add a condition that checks if the last dimension
      of the matrix is equal to the length of the vector:'
