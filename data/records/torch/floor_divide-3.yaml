- - cot: The error is due to the result of torch.floor_divide being of type Float,
      but it can't be cast to the desired output type Int. Looking at the args, the
      dtype of 'self' is float32, while the dtype of 'out' is int32. Therefore, the
      dtypes of 'self' and 'out' should be consistent.
