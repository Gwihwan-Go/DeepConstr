- cot: 'From the given values, it seems that the ''out'' tensor has a different shape
    than the ''input'' tensor. The ''out'' tensor has shape [8] while the ''input''
    tensor has shape [3, 3, 5]. Since the error message indicates that the storage
    is not resizable, the ''out'' tensor should have the same shape as the ''input''
    tensor to avoid this error. Therefore, left : out.shape, op : ==, right : input.shape'
  target: Trying to resize storage that is not resizable
  txt: (out.rank==input.rank and all(out.shape[i]==input.shape[i] for i in range(out.rank))
    and out.is_resizable == True) and (out.shape == input.shape)
- cot: "The error occurs because the 'dim' value provided is out of the valid range\
    \ for the given tensor. The tensor 'input' and 'out' both have a shape of [1],\
    \ which means they have only one dimension. The valid range for 'dim' value in\
    \ this case is [-1, 0]. But the given 'dim' value is 1, which is out of this range.\
    \ \n\nTo prevent this error in the future and generate constraints that do not\
    \ trigger it, we need to ensure that the 'dim' value is always within the valid\
    \ range for the given tensor. \n\nThe constraint for the 'dim' parameter can be\
    \ expressed as:"
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-1, 0], but got 1)
  txt: dim < len(input.shape)
- cot: 'The error occurs because the tensor data type of ''out'' variable is not as
    expected. The expected data type is Float but found Long. Therefore, we need to
    ensure that the ''out'' tensor always has the same dtype as the ''input'' tensor.
    Here, the dtype of the ''input'' tensor is float32, so the ''out'' tensor should
    also have dtype float32.


    The constraint could be expressed as:'
  target: expected scalar_type Float but found Long
  txt: out.dtype == input.dtype
