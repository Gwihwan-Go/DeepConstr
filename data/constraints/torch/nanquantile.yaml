- cot: 'The error suggests that there is an attempt to resize a storage that is not
    resizable. Looking at the given values, the resizing operation could involve the
    ''input'', ''out'', or ''q'' parameters. It''s also noted that ''dim'' is 9, which
    could possibly exceed the dimension of the tensors, leading to a resizing attempt.


    Constraint 1: The dimension must be less than or equal to the dimensions of the
    tensors. So, ''dim'' should be less than or equal to the dimensions of ''input'',
    ''out'', and ''q''.'
  target: Trying to resize storage that is not resizable
  txt: (dim < out.rank) or ((out.shape == input.shape) or ((dim <= len(input.shape))
    and (dim <= len(out.shape))))
- cot: "The error is due to the 'q' value not being within the required range. The\
    \ 'q' value provided is not within the range [0, 1]. Therefore, to prevent this\
    \ error from occurring again, we need to ensure that the 'q' value is always within\
    \ the range [0, 1]. \n\nThe constraint for the 'q' parameter can be expressed\
    \ as:"

  txt: (q <= 1) or (q >= 0)
- cot: "The error occurs because the dimension provided is not within the valid range.\
    \ The given dimension is 6, but based on the shape of the input tensor, the valid\
    \ dimension should be in the range [-2, 1]. \n\nTo prevent this error in the future\
    \ and generate constraints that do not trigger it, the 'dim' value should always\

  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-4, 3], but got 6)

- cot: 'The error arises due to a mismatch in the datatype of ''q'' tensor and the
    ''input'' tensor in the quantile() function. The ''input'' tensor is of type float64,

    type of ''q'' tensor should be the same as that of the ''input'' tensor. Thus,

    is not of the required type. The quantile() function requires that the input tensor
    be of either float or double data type. However, in the arguments provided, the

    tensor should be changed. The logical relationship constraint to avoid this error
