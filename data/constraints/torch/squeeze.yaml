- cot: 'The error occurs because the ''dim'' value provided is outside of the valid
    range for the size of the ''input'' tensor. The ''input'' tensor has a shape of
    [10, 9, 8, 6], which means it has 4 dimensions. The valid range for the ''dim''
    value should be between -4 (the negative of the total number of dimensions) and
    3 (the total number of dimensions minus 1). However, the ''dim'' value provided
    is 8, which is outside of this range.


    To avoid triggering this error, we should ensure that the ''dim'' value is always
    within the valid range for the given ''input'' tensor. This can be expressed as
    the following constraints:'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-4, 3], but got 8)
  txt: (dim >= -len(input.shape) and dim < len(input.shape)) or ((dim in [-1,0]) and
    (dim < len(input.shape)))
