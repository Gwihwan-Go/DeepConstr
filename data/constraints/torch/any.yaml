- cot: "The error occurs because the dimension provided is out of the valid range\
    \ for the given tensor. From the given values, we can see that the tensor has\
    \ a shape of [10, 9, 8], which means it has 3 dimensions (or it is of rank 3).\
    \ However, the provided 'dim' value is 4, which is outside of the expected range\
    \ of [-3, 2]. \n\nTo prevent this error in the future and generate constraints\
    \ that do not trigger it, we need to ensure that the 'dim' value is always within\
    \ the valid range for the given tensor. If we denote the shape of the tensor as\
    \ n, the valid range for the dimension would be [-n, n-1].\n\nThe constraint for\
    \ the 'dim' parameter with these values can be expressed as:"
