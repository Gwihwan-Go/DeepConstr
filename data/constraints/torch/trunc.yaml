- cot: 'The error message indicates that an integer (Int) type was found where a floating

    be float, not integer. The constraints can be defined as following:

    1. For the ''input'' tensor, the data type (dtype) must be float. Thus, Left :
    input.dtype, Op : ==, and Right : float.'
  target: Found dtype Int but expected Float

- cot: 'The error is due to a conflict between the dimensions of the input tensor
    and the output tensor when trying to resize a storage that is not resizable. We
    need to ensure that the dimensions of the input tensor are consistent with the
    dimensions of the output tensor. Therefore, Left: input.shape, Op: ==, and Right:
