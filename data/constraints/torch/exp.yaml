- cot: 'The error is caused because the output tensor''s datatype is not as expected.
    What the args were? The output tensor''s datatype is "ComplexDouble", but it can''t
    be cast to the desired output type "Float". Therefore, the datatype of the output
    tensor should be changed from "ComplexDouble" to "Float". So, Left : out.dtype;
    Op : ==; Right : Float'
  target: result type ComplexDouble can't be cast to the desired output type Float
  txt: out.dtype == Float
- cot: "The error is due to the fact that the 'input' and 'out' tensors are not of\
    \ the same dimension, and the program is trying to resize a storage that is not\
    \ resizable. \n\nThe dimensions of 'input' tensor are [9, 8, 6] and that of 'out'\
    \ tensor are [3, 8, 8]. It seems like the first dimension of both tensors is causing\
    \ the issue. \n\nTherefore, the dimensions of 'input' and 'out' tensors should\
    \ be the same or at least the storage should be resizable."
