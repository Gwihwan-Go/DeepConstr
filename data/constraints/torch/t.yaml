- cot: 'The error occurs because the tensor operation ''t()'' only supports tensors
    with 2 or fewer dimensions, but the input tensor has 5 dimensions. To prevent
    this error, we need to ensure that the tensor passed into ''t()'' operation has
    2 or fewer dimensions. This can be expressed as the following constraint:'
  target: t() expects a tensor with <= 2 dimensions, but self is 5D
