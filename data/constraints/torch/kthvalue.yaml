- cot: 'The error is triggered because the ''kthvalue_cpu'' function is not implemented
    for ''ComplexFloat'' tensor data type. From the given values, the input tensor
    is of ''Complex64'' data type. Therefore, the data type of the ''input'' tensor,
    which is type(input), should be corrected to not be ''ComplexFloat''. So, Left
    : type(input), Op : !=, and Right : ''ComplexFloat''.'
  target: '"kthvalue_cpu" not implemented for ''ComplexFloat'''
  txt: type(input) != 'ComplexFloat'
- cot: 'The error indicates that the dimension provided is outside the valid range
    for the tensor. Therefore, we need to ensure that the dimension is always within
    the valid range. If we denote the shape of the tensor as n, the valid range for
    the dimension would be [-n, n-1]. However, the error message also indicates that
    the dimension can be -1 when the tensor is empty. Thus, the constraints should
    be:


    1. If the tensor is not empty:'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-3, 2], but got -4)
  txt: ((len(input.shape) == 0) and (dim < len(input.shape)) and (len(input.shape)
    == 0)) or (dim >= -len(input.shape) and dim < len(input.shape)) or ((len(input.shape)
    == 0) and (dim < len(input.shape)) and (len(input.shape) == 0))
- cot: 'The error occurs because the value of ''k'' is out of range for the specified
    dimension of the tensor. Here, the dimension (''dim'') is 2, and the size of that
    dimension in the input tensor is 1. The ''k'' value is 0, which is not out of
    range for the dimension size. However, ''kthvalue()'' function in PyTorch returns
    the k-th smallest element of the input tensor along a specified dimension. If
    ''k'' is 0, it implies there are no elements before the k-th element, which is
    not possible. Therefore, ''k'' should be greater than 0 and less than or equal
    to the size of the specified dimension.


    The constraint for the ''k'' parameter can be expressed as:'
  target: 'kthvalue(): selected number k out of range for dimension 0'
  txt: k > 0
