- cot: 'The error is suggesting that the function expects a 1D tensor but got a 2D
    tensor of shape (10, 9). This implies that the tensor should have only one dimension.
    We can enforce this by setting a constraint on the dimension of the ''input''
    tensor.


    The constraint for the ''input'' tensor can be expressed as:'
