- cot: 'Error is triggered because the ''input'' tensor is not at least 1-dimensional.
    Looking at the arguments, the ''input'' tensor seems to be 0-dimensional. Therefore,
    we need to ensure that the number of dimensions of ''input'' tensor is at least
    1. The constraint can be formulated as such:'
  target: split expects at least a 1-dimensional tensor
  txt: input.ndims() >= 1
- cot: 'The error implies that the ''split_size'' argument is expected to be an integer,
    not a list. The provided ''split_size'' value is [0], which is a list. Therefore,
    the type of ''split_size'' should be corrected to ''int''. Hence, Left: type(split_size),
    Op: ''=='', and Right: ''int''.'
  target: 'split_copy(): argument ''split_size'' must be int, not list'
  txt: type(split_size) == 'int'
- cot: 'The error is due to an invalid split size in relation to the dimension size.
    Looking at the args, split_size is 0 but the dimension size is 9. The split_size
    can only be 0 if the dimension size is also 0. Therefore, if split_size == 0,
    then input.shape[dim] should also be 0. Thus, Left : input.shape[dim], Op : ==,
    Right : 0 if split_size == 0.'
  target: split_size can only be 0 if dimension size is 0, but got dimension size
    of 9
  txt: input.shape[dim]==0
