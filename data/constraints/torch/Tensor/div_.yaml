- cot: 'The error seems to be due to an invalid ''rounding_mode'' being used on a
    certain value. The ''rounding_mode'' argument specifies the strategy to use for
    rounding when necessary. Let''s see what the args were. We have {''value'': 7.7436941}
    and ''rounding_mode''. There are several rounding modes available in PyTorch,
    such as ''trunc'', ''floor'', ''ceil'', ''round'' etc. The ''value'' should be
    a floating point number for the rounding operation to make sense. Therefore, ''value''
    should be a float.'
