- cot: 'The error arises because the dimension specified is -1, but the tensor does
    not have any dimensions. Looking at the args, the ''input'' tensor is a scalar
    (it has no dimensions) but ''dim'' is set to -1, which is usually used to refer
    to the last dimension of a tensor. Therefore, the tensor ''input'' must have at
    least one dimension. So, Left : len(input.shape), Op : >, Right : 0.'
  target: Dimension specified as -1 but tensor has no dimensions
  txt: len(input.shape) > 0
- cot: 'Looking at the provided values, the issue is the ''dim'' parameter. The tensor
    input has shape [10, 9], so it is a rank 2 tensor. The valid dimension values
    for this tensor would be in the range of [-2, 1]. However, ''dim'' is given as
    7, which is out of this range and results in the error.


    To generate constraints that do not trigger this error, the ''dim'' value should
    always be within the valid range for the given tensor. This can be expressed in
    code as follows:'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-2, 1], but got 7)
  txt: dim >= -len(input.shape) and dim < len(input.shape)
