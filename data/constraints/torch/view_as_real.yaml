- cot: The error is triggered because 'view_as_real' function is only supported for
    complex tensors. In this case, 'input' tensor dtype is 'float32' which is not
    a complex type. Therefore, to avoid the same error with the previous answer, we
    should ensure that 'input' has a complex type.
