- cot: "The error is triggered due to the attempt to resize a non-resizable storage.\
    \ It seems that either the 'dim' value or the tensor 'input' dimensions are involved\
    \ in this issue. The 'input' has dimensions [8, 1, 6, 9, 7, 1, 1] and 'dim' is\
    \ 6. The output tensor 'out' has dimensions [8,8] and doesn't seem to directly\
    \ relate to the error. We need to ensure that the dimensions of the 'input' tensor\
    \ is consistent with the 'dim' value and that no resizing is attempted on non-resizable\
    \ tensors. Therefore, the constraints need to be: \n\nLeft: len(input.shape),\
    \ Op: ==, Right: dim"
  target: Trying to resize storage that is not resizable

- cot: 'The error suggests that the ''dim'' value is out of the valid range. The valid
    range for dimensions is from -1 to the rank of the tensor - 1, in this case it
    is from -1 to 0 since the input tensor is of rank 1 (it''s a 1-dimensional tensor
    with 10 elements). The ''dim'' value of 7 is outside this range, hence the error.
    The constraints can be described as follows: ''dim'' should be a valid dimension
    of the input tensor, i.e., it should be >= -input.rank and < input.rank. For the
    given values, the constraint becomes -1 <= dim < 1. The ''out'' tensor seems unrelated
    to this error.'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-1, 0], but got 7)
  txt: (dim >= -1 and dim <= 0) or (dim < len(input.shape))
