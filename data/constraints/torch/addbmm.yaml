    not have sufficient dimensions. Therefore, the constraint should be that ''batch2''
    should have at least 1 dimension, and ''input'' and ''out'' should have at least
    2 dimensions. Therefore, Left: len(batch2.shape), Op: >=, Right: 1, and Left:

    access the dimension at index 2 of the ''out'' tensor, but the rank of the ''out''
    tensor is only 2 (valid indices are in the range [-2, 1]). Therefore, the index
    should be less than the rank of the ''out'' tensor and greater than or equal to
