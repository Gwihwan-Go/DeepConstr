rules:
- cot: 'The error "Dimension specified as 2 but tensor has no dimensions" implies
    that there is some operation being performed on a 2-dimensional tensor. But, the
    tensor doesn''t have enough dimensions. In the given values, ''batch2'' is the
    only tensor with no dimensions. But ''input'' and ''out'' are tensors that do
    not have sufficient dimensions. Therefore, the constraint should be that ''batch2''
    should have at least 1 dimension, and ''input'' and ''out'' should have at least
    2 dimensions. Therefore, Left: len(batch2.shape), Op: >=, Right: 1, and Left:
    len(input.shape) and len(out.shape), Op: >=, Right: 2.'
  target: Dimension specified as 2 but tensor has no dimensions
  txt: len(out.shape)>=2
- cot: 'The error is due to an invalid dimension index. The function is trying to
    access the dimension at index 2 of the ''out'' tensor, but the rank of the ''out''
    tensor is only 2 (valid indices are in the range [-2, 1]). Therefore, the index
    should be less than the rank of the ''out'' tensor and greater than or equal to
    the negative of the rank. So, Left : 2, Op : <, Right : len(out.shape) and Left
    : 2, Op : >=, Right : -len(out.shape).'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-1, 0], but got 1)
  txt: 2 >= -len(out.shape)
