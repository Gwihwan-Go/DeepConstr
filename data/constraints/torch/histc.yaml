    at the provided values, we have ''bins'' with a value of 7, ''input'' and ''out''
    both as float32 tensors. In this case, we should ensure that the ''bins'' value
    should be less than or equal to the size of ''input'' and ''out''. Therefore,

- cot: 'The error occurs because the ''bins'' value is not as expected. Looking at
    the args, ''bins'' is 0 but it needs to be greater than 0 for the torch.histogram()
    function to work correctly. Therefore, Left : bins, which is the number of bins,
    should be corrected. It indicates that it cannot be 0, so Op : !=, and Right :
    0. Also, it should be greater than 0, so Op : >, and Right : 0.'

- cot: 'The error is caused because the dtypes of the tensors input and hist are not
    the same. The dtype of input is int while the dtype of hist is float. Let''s see
    what the args were. It seems the dtype of input is TensorDType.int32 and the dtype
    of out is TensorDType.float32. Therefore, they should be corrected to have the
    same dtype. Therefore, Left : input.dtype, and Op : ==, Right : out.dtype'
