    Let''s see what the args were. It seems ''self'' and ''source'' should have the
    same data types. Currently, ''self'' has dtype Long and ''source'' has dtype ComplexDouble.
    Therefore, the data types of ''self'' and ''source'' should be corrected. It says
    it should have the same dtype, so Operation : ==, and Right : dtype of ''self''.'

    \ number of ones in 'mask'. This means that the 'source' tensor does not have\
    \ enough elements to match the 'true' values in the 'mask'. \n\nThe 'mask' tensor\
    \ is a boolean tensor which is typically used to select elements from the 'source'\
    \ tensor where the mask is True. In this case, the 'mask' tensor is empty, which\
    \ implies that it does not have any elements, so the number of ones in 'mask'\
    \ should be zero. \n\nHowever, the 'source' tensor is non-empty with shape [0,\
    \ 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 6] which means it has elements. \n\nSo, looking at the error,\
    \ there seems to be a contradiction as it says number of elements of source is\
    \ less than number of ones in mask, which is not possible as per the given values.\
    \ \n\nThe constraints should be:\n1. The number of elements in 'source' should\
    \ be greater than or equal to the number of ones in 'mask'.\n2. The 'mask' tensor\
    \ shape should match with 'source' tensor shape or be broadcastable to 'source'\
    \ tensor shape."
