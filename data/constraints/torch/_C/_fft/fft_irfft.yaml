    Let''s see what the args were. It seems that the input tensor has a dtype of float16.
    To avoid this error, the input tensor needs to be converted to a supported dtype.
    One common supported dtype is float32. So, input.dtype should be float32. Therefore,

- cot: "The error is due to an attempt to resize a storage that is not resizable.\
    \ This can happen when you are trying to change the dimension of a tensor ('out')\
    \ which is not allowed. \n\nFor instance, in the given values, 'input' tensor\
    \ has dimensions [1, 6] and the 'out' tensor has dimensions [1, 1]. Trying to\
    \ resize 'out' tensor to match 'input' tensor's dimensions is not allowed as it\
    \ would require resizing the storage of 'out' tensor, which is not resizable.\
    \ \n\nWe need to ensure that the dimensions of 'out' tensor match with 'input'\
    \ tensor. Here, the dimension 'dim' is 0. That is, we are working on the first\
    \ dimension of 'out' tensor. \n\nTherefore, our constraint should be that the\
    \ size of 'out' tensor along the dimension 'dim' should be equal to the size of\
    \ 'input' tensor along the same dimension."
  target: Trying to resize storage that is not resizable
  txt: dim <= len(out.shape) - 1
- cot: "The error is caused by the fact that the number of data points specified,\
    \ 'n', is 0. In the context of tensor operations, 'n' typically specifies the\
    \ number of elements along a certain dimension, and a value of 0 is invalid. From\
    \ the given values, we see that 'dim' is 2, which means we are operating along\
    \ the third dimension of 'input' tensor. The length of this dimension is 6, which\
    \ should be the valid range of 'n'. \n\nIn order to prevent this error from occurring\
    \ in the future, we need to ensure that 'n' is always within the valid range for\
    \ the given tensor and dimension. Thus, the constraint for the 'n' parameter can\
    \ be expressed as:"

- cot: 'The error is triggered because the output tensor ''out'' is of Long type but
    the function ''irfft'' expects a floating point tensor. Let''s see what the args
    were. The ''out'' tensor is of type Long, and it seems to be the problem. Therefore,
    the data type of tensor ''out'' should be corrected, which is out.dtype. Therefore,
