rules:
- cot: The error indicates that there's an attempt to resize storage that is not resizable.
    It seems the issue lies with the 'input' or 'out' tensors, which are not resizable.
    Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the dimensions of the input and output tensors
    match or the output tensor has enough size to hold the input tensor. This means
    that the total size of 'input' tensor should be less than or equal to the total
    size of 'out' tensor.
  target: Trying to resize storage that is not resizable
  txt: (dim >= 0) or (len(input) <= len(out))
- cot: "From the provided values, we can see that the 'dim' value is 7, but the input\
    \ tensor only has 2 dimensions. This is why the error is being triggered. The\
    \ 'dim' parameter should be less than the number of dimensions in the input tensor\
    \ and greater than or equal to the negative of this number. \n\nTherefore, the\
    \ constraint for the 'dim' parameter can be expressed as follows:"
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-1, 0], but got 5)
  txt: (dim < len(input.shape)) and (dim >= -len(input.shape))
- cot: 'Error is triggered because fft function expects a complex output tensor but
    got Float. What''s the args were? Based on the given values, it seems that the
    output tensor is of type Float32, but fft function requires a complex output tensor.
    Therefore, we can revise the constraints as follows:'
  target: fft expects a complex output tensor, but got Float
  txt: out.dtype == complex
- cot: 'The error is due to an invalid number of data points. The ''n'' value provided
    is 0, which is not a valid number of data points. The value for ''n'' should be
    more than 0 to prevent this error. Hence, to prevent this error from happening
    again, the constraints should be:'
  target: Invalid number of data points (-1) specified
  txt: n > 0
