- cot: 'Based on the given values, the error arises because the function is trying
    to access the dimension -2 of a tensor that has no dimensions. The ''input'' tensor
    is a scalar, but the function is expecting it to have at least 2 dimensions. Therefore,
    Left : len(input.shape), which is the number of dimensions of the ''input'' tensor,
    should be corrected. It says that should be greater than or equal to 2, so Op
    : >=, and Right : 2.'
