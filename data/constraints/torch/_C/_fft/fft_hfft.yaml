- cot: 'The error occurs because the ''dim'' value is set to -1 while the ''input''
    tensor has no dimensions. The ''dim'' value refers to the dimension of the tensor
    that we want to perform operations on, and -1 usually refers to the last dimension.
    But in this case, the ''input'' tensor is zero-dimensional, so there is no last
    dimension. Therefore, Left : len(input.shape), which is the number of dimensions
    of the input tensor. Op: >, because it should be greater than 0 to have any dimension.
    Right : 0, because we compare it with zero.'
  target: Dimension specified as -1 but tensor has no dimensions
  txt: len(input.shape)>0
- cot: "The error is due to trying to resize storage that is not resizable. The values\
    \ indicate that 'input' and 'out' are tensors with specific shapes. In this case,\
    \ the 'out' tensor appears to have a different shape than 'input'. Also, 'dim'\
    \ and 'n' values seem to exceed the dimensions of the 'input' tensor. So, the\
    \ constraint could be that the 'dim' and 'n' should be less than or equal to the\
    \ dimensions of the 'input' tensor. The 'input' and 'out' tensors need to have\
    \ the same shape or 'out' tensor needs to be resizable. \n\nTherefore, \n- Left:\

    \ n\n- Left: input.shape, Op: ==, Right: out.shape"

- cot: "The error arises because the function 'hfft' expects a floating point output\
    \ tensor, but got Long. It seems 'out' tensor is of type Long ( int64).\
    \ Therefore, the data type of 'out' should be corrected. \n\nThe Left : out.dtype.\
    \ It says that it should be a floating point tensor, so Op : ==, and Right : float.\

- cot: 'The error occurs because the dimension provided is out of the valid range.
    Let''s see what the args were. It appears the given dimension is 7 which is out
    of this range. To prevent this error in the future and generate constraints that
    do not trigger it, we need to ensure that the "dim" value is always within the
    valid range for the given tensor. If we denote the shape of the tensor as n, the
    valid range for the dimension would be [-n, n-1].


    The constraint for the ''dim'' parameter can be expressed as:'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-6, 5], but got 7)
  txt: dim >= -len(input.shape) and dim < len(input.shape)
- cot: 'The error is due to an invalid number of data points specified for the operation.
    From the args, we can see that ''n'' is set to 0 which is invalid as it should
    be greater than 0 to specify valid data points. To prevent this error from occurring
    again, we need to ensure that ''n'' is always greater than 0. Therefore, the constraint
    for ''n'' can be expressed as:'
  target: Invalid number of data points (0) specified
  txt: n > 0
