rules:
- cot: 'The error is because ''dim'' value is out of the valid range. The valid range
    of ''dim'' is between -3 and 2, but ''dim'' is currently 4. The value of ''dim''
    should be corrected. It should fall between -3 and 2. Therefore, left : ''dim'',
    op : >= and <=, right : -3 and 2 respectively.'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-3, 2], but got 4)
  txt: -3 <= dim and dim <= 2
- cot: 'Error is triggered because the dimension specified as 0 but tensor has no
    dimensions. Let''s see what the args were. The ''input'' tensor has no dimensions,
    but ''dim'' is set as 0. Therefore, we need to ensure the ''input'' tensor has
    at least one dimension for ''dim'' to be 0. Thus, the constraint would be Left
    : len(input.shape), Op : >, Right : 0.'
  target: Dimension specified as 0 but tensor has no dimensions
  txt: len(input.shape) > 0
