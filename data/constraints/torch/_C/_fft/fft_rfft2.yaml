    the function ''rfftn'' expects a complex output tensor. Let''s look at the arguments.
    The ''out'' tensor is of dtype float32, which is incorrect. Hence, the dtype of
    ''out'' tensor needs to be corrected, i.e., out.dtype. Therefore, Left : out.dtype.
    It states that the expected type is complex, so Op : ==, and Right : Complex.'
  target: rfftn expects a complex output tensor, but got Float
  txt: out.dtype == Complex
- cot: 'Error is triggered because of trying to resize storage. Let''s see what the
    args were. The ''out'' tensor doesn''t match the shape of the ''input'' tensor.
    Therefore, Left : out.shape, Right : input.shape, and Op : ==.'
