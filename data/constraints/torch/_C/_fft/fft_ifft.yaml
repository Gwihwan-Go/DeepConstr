- cot: 'The error "Unsupported dtype Half" is triggered because the dtype of ''input''
    tensor is float16 (also known as Half). The unsupported dtype could be due to
    a specific function or operation which does not support float16. To prevent this
    error from occurring again, you need to ensure that the dtype of ''input'' tensor
    should not be float16. Therefore, the logical relationship constraint could be
    defined as follows:'
  target: Unsupported dtype Half
  txt: '''input''.dtype != ''float16'''
- cot: "The error is indicating a type mismatch. The 'out' tensor is of dtype ComplexDouble\
    \ while the expected dtype is ComplexFloat. This suggests that the 'out' tensor\
    \ has a higher precision than what is expected. \n\nGiven the inputs, the constraint\
    \ to prevent this error would be to ensure that the dtype of the 'out' tensor\
    \ matches the expected dtype. This can be enforced with the following constraint:"
  target: Found dtype ComplexDouble but expected ComplexFloat
  txt: out.dtype == TensorDType.ComplexFloat
- cot: 'The error message indicates that there is an attempt to resize a storage that
    is not resizable. This could be due to the ''dim'' value being 0. It could also
    be due to the mismatch between the input and output tensor data types. Therefore,
    several constraints need to be checked:


    1. ''dim'' should not be zero, so the constraint is:'
  target: Trying to resize storage that is not resizable
  txt: (out.rank==input.rank) and (n <= len(input))
- cot: 'This error arises because the inverse Fourier transform (ifft) function expects
    to produce a complex output tensor, but the provided output tensor ''out'' is
    of type Float. To fix this error, the ''out'' tensor should be a complex tensor.
    Let''s look at the args. It indicates ''out'' tensor is of type float32. Therefore,
    Left : type(out). It says that the type of ''out'' should be complex, so Op :
    ==, and Right : complex.'
  target: ifft expects a complex output tensor, but got Float
  txt: type(out) == complex
- cot: "The error occurs because the 'dim' value provided is 7, which is out of the\
    \ valid range. The tensor has 3 dimensions, so valid 'dim' values are in the range\
    \ [-3, 2] (inclusive). The 'dim' value should be greater than or equal to -3 and\
    \ less than or equal to 2. \n\nThis can be captured with the constraint:"
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-3, 2], but got 7)
  txt: dim < len(input.shape)
- cot: "The error is due to an invalid number of data points specified. In the given\
    \ values, the number of data points 'n' is 0, which is invalid. To avoid this\
    \ error in the future, we need to create a constraint that 'n' should always be\
    \ greater than 0. \nThe constraint can be expressed as:"
  target: Invalid number of data points (0) specified
  txt: n > 0
