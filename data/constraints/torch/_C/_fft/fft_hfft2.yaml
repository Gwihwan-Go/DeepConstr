    Let''s see what the input parameters were. It appears we have ''input'' tensor
    with shape [6, 8, 6, 6, 1, 4, 4, 1, 2, 2] and ''out'' tensor with a shape of [8,
    2, 8, 6]. It seems the ''out'' tensor''s shape doesn''t match the ''input'' tensor''s
    shape. Hence, it is trying to resize the ''out'' tensor that is not resizable.
    Therefore, the constraint can be that the shape of the ''out'' tensor should be
    the same as the shape of the ''input'' tensor. Left : out.shape, Op : ==, Right
    : input.shape.'
  target: Trying to resize storage that is not resizable
  txt: (out.shape == input.shape) and (out.shape== input.shape)
