- cot: 'Error is triggered because we are trying to resize a tensor (''out'') that
    is not resizable. From the given values, ''out'' tensor has a shape of [3], and
    ''input'' tensor has a shape of [9, 10, 3]. The ''out'' tensor should have the
    same shape as the ''input'' tensor for the operation to be successful. Therefore,
    left : out.shape, and op : ==, right : input.shape.'
  target: Trying to resize storage that is not resizable
  txt: out.shape == input.shape
- cot: The error occurs because the result type Float cannot be cast to the required
    output type Int. The data type of the 'input' and 'out' tensor is int32. The constraint
    can be defined to check if the type of the 'input' is equal to the type of the
    'out', which should not trigger the error.
  target: result type Float can't be cast to the desired output type Int
  txt: (out.dtype == tf.float32) and (type('input') == type('out'))
