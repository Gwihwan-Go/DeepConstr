- cot: 'The error is because the function "bessel_j0_cpu" is not implemented for ''Half''
    data type. The input tensor is of type ''float16'' (also known as ''Half'') which
    is incompatible. The output tensor is of type ''float32'' which might be acceptable
    as there is no error mentioning about the output tensor in the error message.
    Therefore, the Left : type(input) should be corrected to not be ''float16''. Op
    : != , and Right : float16.'
  target: '"bessel_j0_cpu" not implemented for ''Half'''
  txt: type(input) != "float16"
- cot: 'The error is caused because the output type of the tensor is not as expected.
    What the args were? The output tensor type is ''int32'', but the result type is
    ''float32'' which can''t be cast to ''int32''. Therefore, the output type ''int32''
    should be changed to ''float32'' to match the result type. Hence, Left : out.dtype;
    Op : ==; Right : input.dtype'
  target: result type Float can't be cast to the desired output type Int
  txt: (out.dtype == 'float32') and (out.dtype == input.dtype)
- cot: 'This error is triggered when the output tensor is not resizable, but a resize
    operation is attempted on it. The output tensor is not resizable when it is defined
    as a constant or when it has been created with a fixed size that cannot be changed.
    Thus, the constraint should be that the output tensor is resizable. We can represent
    this by the following condition:


    `out.resizable == True`


    This condition ensures that the output tensor is resizable before any resize operation
    is attempted on it.


    Hence, the complete constraints would be:'
  target: Trying to resize storage that is not resizable
  txt: out.rank==input.rank and all(out.shape[i]==input.shape[i] for i in range(out.rank))
    and out.resizable == True
