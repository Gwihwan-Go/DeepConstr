- cot: The error occurs because the output tensor 'out' has a different shape than
    the input tensor and is trying to be resized to match the input. However, the
    'out' tensor is not resizable. The shapes of 'input' and 'out' tensors should
    be the same for the operation to be successful. So, we need to ensure that the
    dimensions of 'out' tensor match that of the 'input' tensor.
  target: Trying to resize storage that is not resizable
  txt: out.shape == input.shape
- cot: 'The error is caused because the operation is trying to cast a float type to
    an integer type, which is not possible. Let''s see what the args were. The type
    of ''input'' and ''out'' are both ''int'', but the result is of type ''Float''.
    Therefore, the type of the result should be equal to the type of ''input'' and
    ''out''. So, Left : type(result), Op : ==, Right : input.dtype, out.dtype. Also,
    the dimensions of ''input'' and ''out'' should be the same, so Left : input.shape,
    Op : ==, Right : out.shape.'
  target: result type ComplexFloat can't be cast to the desired output type Float
  txt: (out.dtype == Float) and (input.shape == out.shape)
