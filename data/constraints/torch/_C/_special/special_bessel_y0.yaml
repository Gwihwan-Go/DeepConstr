- cot: 'Error is triggered because of we are trying to resize storageLet''s see what
    the args were. I guess the storage indicates ''out'' tensor. so, it means that
    ''out'' tensor shape should be matched with the operation results. in this operation,
    the result shape is input.shape. Therefore, left : out.shape, out.rank op : ==
