- cot: 'The error is triggered because the result type of ''Float'' cannot be cast
    to ''Int''. As we can see, the dtype of ''input'' is '' float32'' and
    the dtype of ''out'' is '' int32''. This creates a type inconsistency
    when attempting to cast. Therefore, the dtypes of ''input'' and ''out'' should
    be the same to prevent the error. Left : input.dtype, op : ==, comparator : out.dtype'
  target: result type Float can't be cast to the desired output type Long
  txt: input.dtype==out.dtype
- cot: 'Error is triggered because we are trying to resize the ''out'' tensor with
    shape [8,2,1], but it is not resizable. From the given values, the ''input'' tensor
    has a shape [6, 8, 6, 6, 1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 2]. The ''out'' tensor shape should match
    with the ''input'' tensor shape. Therefore, left : out.shape, out.rank op : ==
    right : input.shape, input.rank.

    This implies that the ''out'' tensor should have the same rank and shape as the
    ''input'' tensor.'

    are of type float16. Therefore, to prevent this error, the dtype of both tensors
    should not be ''Half'' or float16. This means, Left : input.dtype, Right : ''Half'',
