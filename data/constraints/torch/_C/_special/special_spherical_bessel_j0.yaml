- cot: The error indicates that there is an attempt to resize storage that is not
    resizable. The values provided include a 'x' tensor with shape [6, 8, 6, 6, 1,
    3, 4, 1, 3, 2] and 'out' tensor with shape [8, 2, 1]. This could be due to a mismatch
    between the shape of 'x' and 'out' tensor, or attempting to change the size of
    a tensor that is already defined and not supposed to be changed. Therefore, one
    constraint could be that the dimensions of 'x' and 'out' must be compatible for
    the operation being performed. Additionally, the size of a tensor should not be
    changed after it has been defined if it is not designed to be resizable.
  target: Trying to resize storage that is not resizable
  txt: len(x.shape) == len(out.shape) and all(x[i] == out[i] for i in range(len(x.shape)))
- cot: 'The error message states that a value of type ''Float'' cannot be cast to
    ''Int''. This means that the output type is ''Int'' but the function is trying
    to assign a ''Float'' value to it. Therefore, the output type should be ''Float''
    or the input type should be ''Int''. Hence, Left : type(out) or type(x), Op :
    ==, Right : Float or Int'
  target: result type Float can't be cast to the desired output type Short
  txt: type(out)==Float
