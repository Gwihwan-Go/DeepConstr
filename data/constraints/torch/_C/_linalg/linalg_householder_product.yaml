- cot: The error is because the second last dimension of the 'input' tensor is not
    greater than or equal to the last dimension of 'input' tensor. Therefore, the
    constraint should be 'input'.shape[-2] >= 'input'.shape[-1].
  target: 'torch.linalg.householder_product: input.shape[-1] must be greater than
    or equal to tau.shape[-1]'
  txt: '''input''.shape[-2] >= ''input''.shape[-1]'
- cot: 'The error message indicates that the input tensor must have at least 2 dimensions
    for the torch.linalg.householder_product operation. Looking at the given values,
    we can see that ''input'' tensor has only one dimension. In order to avoid the
    error, we need to ensure that the ''input'' tensor has at least 2 dimensions.
    Therefore, the logical relationship constraint can be expressed as follows, Left
    : len(input.shape), Op : >=, Right : 2'
  target: 'torch.linalg.householder_product: input must have at least 2 dimensions.'
  txt: len(input.shape) >= 2
- cot: 'The error is caused due to mismatch in dimensions of ''input'' and ''tau''
    tensors. The ''tau'' tensor is expected to have one dimension less than ''input''.
    However, in the current situation ''tau'' has 5 dimensions and ''input'' has 2.
    So, we need to ensure that the number of dimensions of ''tau'' is one less than
    ''input''. Therefore, Left : tau.dim, Op : ==, and Right : input.dim - 1.'
  target: 'torch.linalg.householder_product: Expected tau to have one dimension less
    than input, but got tau.ndim equal to 5 and input.ndim is equal to 2'
  txt: tau.dim == input.dim - 1
