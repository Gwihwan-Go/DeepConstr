- cot: 'The error is caused because the ''linalg.lu_factor'' function is trying to
    perform LU factorization without pivoting on the CPU, which is not supported.
    The ''pivot'' argument is False, which suggests that pivoting is turned off. Therefore,
    to avoid this error, we must ensure that the ''pivot'' argument is always True
    when running on the CPU. The parameters ''A'' and ''check_errors'' don''t seem
    to affect this error. So, the constraint would be:'
  target: 'linalg.lu_factor: LU without pivoting is not implemented on the CPU'
  txt: pivot == True
- cot: 'Error is triggered because the function torch.lu_factor expects a tensor with
    2 or more dimensions, but got size [] instead. It seems the tensor ''A'' is empty.
    We need to ensure that the tensor ''A'' has at least 2 dimensions. Therefore,
    the constraint should be:'
  target: 'torch.lu_factor: Expected tensor with 2 or more dimensions. Got size: []
    instead'
