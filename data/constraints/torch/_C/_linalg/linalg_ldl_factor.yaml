- cot: 'Error is triggered because the input tensor A doesn''t have at least 2 dimensions.
    What the args were? It seems dimension of input tensor is not enough. Therefore,
    input tensor should have at least 2 dimensions. Hence, we should correct this
    by checking the dimension of the input tensor. We can revise the constraints as
    follows:'
  target: 'torch.linalg.ldl_factor_ex: The input tensor A must have at least 2 dimensions.'
  txt: len(input.shape) >= 2
- cot: 'The error is due to the input tensor data type. The function ''torch.linalg.ldl_factor_ex''
    expects a tensor of floating point or complex data type, but the input tensor
    is of type int32. Therefore, the constraint should be that the data type of the
    input tensor needs to be a floating point or complex. So, Left : input.dtype,
    Op : ==, Right : torch.float32 or torch.complex64'
  target: 'torch.linalg.ldl_factor_ex: Expected a floating point or complex tensor
