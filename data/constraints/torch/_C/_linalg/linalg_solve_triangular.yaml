- cot: 'The error is caused because ''A'' must be batches of square matrices, but
    the provided input is a 4 x 8 matrix. Let''s see what the args were. It seems
    that the ''input'' tensor and ''B'' tensor are not square matrices. To generate
    constraints that do not trigger this error, we need to ensure that ''input'' and
    ''B'' are both square matrices.


    The constraint for the ''input'' and ''B'' tensors can be expressed as:'
  target: 'linalg.solve_triangular: A must be batches of square matrices, but they
    are 4 by 8 matrices'
  txt: len(input.shape) == 2 and input.shape[0] == input.shape[1]
- cot: 'The error is triggered because the input tensor A should have at least 2 dimensions,
    but it is not the case here. It seems ''B'' is the input tensor A, since it matches
    the dimensionality requirement. ''input'' can''t be tensor A because it only has
    one dimension. Therefore, Left : len(input.shape), op : >=, and Right : 2.'
  target: 'linalg.solve_triangular: The input tensor A must have at least 2 dimensions.'
  txt: (len(B.shape) >= 2) and (len(input.shape)>=2)
- cot: 'The error message suggests that the shapes of A and B in the equation AX =
    B are incompatible. Let''s see what the args were. It seems that the shape of
    ''B'' is (9,8,6,8) and the shape of ''input'' (which seems to be A in this context)
    is (1,1). These shapes are inconsistent. Thus, the shapes of A and B should be
    modified to match. A is a square matrix, so its shape should be (n,n), and B is
    a matrix with the same number of rows as A, so its shape should be (n,m). So,
    Op : ==, Right : (n,n) for ''input'' and (n,m) for ''B''.'
  target: 'linalg.solve_triangular: Incompatible shapes of A and B for the equation
    AX = B (1x1 and 6x8)'

- cot: 'The error is due to an attempt to resize a tensor that is not resizable. Judging
    from the given args, it seems ''out'' tensor is the storage that is attempted
    to be resized. The shape of ''out'' tensor should match the operation results.
    In this operation, the resulting shape is ''B''. Therefore, Left : out.shape,
    out.rank Op : == Right : B.shape, B.rank.'

    type but found a half scalar type instead. Looking at the provided values, ''out''
    tensor is of half type, while ''input'' tensor is of float32 type. This discrepancy
    is likely the source of the error. Therefore, the Left : type(out) should be corrected
    to match the type of ''input''. Op : ''=='', Right : Float or type(input).'
