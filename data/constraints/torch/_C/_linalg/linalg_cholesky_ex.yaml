- cot: 'The error is due to the ''cholesky_cpu'' function not being implemented for
    ''Half'' (float16) data type. It seems like the ''input'' tensor is of type ''Half''.
    Therefore, the data type of ''input'' should be corrected. It should not be ''Half''.
    So, type(input) : != ''Half''. Also, as the function ''cholesky_cpu'' is not defined
    for ''Half'', the ''input'' tensor should be converted to a data type that is
    compatible with the ''cholesky_cpu'' function.'

- cot: "The error message suggests that the Cholesky factorization failed because\
    \ the input is not positive-definite. This often happens when the input is not\
    \ a symmetric matrix, or when the input is not positive-definite. \n\nFor a matrix\
    \ to be positive-definite, all its eigenvalues must be positive. However, the\
    \ previous answer considered the transpose of the input tensor, which is not necessary\
    \ for checking positive-definiteness. Additionally, the previous answer used the\
    \ 'eigval' function, which is not defined in the given set of symbols.\n\nConsidering\
    \ the given set of symbols, the correct answer would be to ensure that the 'input'\
    \ tensor is symmetric and positive-definite.\n\nIt seems the 'upper' flag is not\
    \ relevant to the error, but it's worth noting that if 'upper' is True, the input\
    \ should be an upper triangular matrix, which is a more specific form of symmetry.\n\
    \nThe constraints for the 'input' tensor could be:\n\n- The 'input' tensor should\
    \ be symmetric, which means it should be equal to its transpose: 'input' == 'input.T'\n\
    - The 'input' tensor should be positive-definite, which could be checked by making\
    \ sure all its eigenvalues are positive. However, this cannot be expressed with\
    \ the given set of symbols.\n\nAnother possible issue is that the 'input' tensor\
    \ has more than two dimensions (its shape is [8, 4, 4]). The Cholesky decomposition\
    \ is defined for 2D matrices, so the 'input' tensor should have exactly two dimensions.\n\
    \nSo, the constraints could be:\n\n- The 'input' tensor should have exactly two\
    \ dimensions: 'len(input.shape)' == 2\n- The 'input' tensor should be symmetric:\
    \ 'input' == 'input.T'\n\nThe constraints represented in the given symbol language\
    \ could be:"
