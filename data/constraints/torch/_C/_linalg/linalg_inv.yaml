- cot: 'The error is triggered because the tensor ''A'' does not have at least 2 dimensions.
    Let''s see what the args were. ''A'' is a tensor of shape [8] which only has 1
    dimension. Therefore, Left : len(A.shape), which is the number of dimensions in
    tensor ''A'', should be at least 2. So, Op : >=, and Right : 2.'

    It seems like the ''out'' tensor has been attempted to be resized. From the provided
    args, ''out'' has a shape of [8] but the ''A'' tensor has a shape of [6, 10, 10].
    This could be the reason for the resizing attempt. Therefore, the shapes of ''out''

    have a double data type, but currently it has a float data type. Let''s see what
    the args were. According to the values, the ''out'' tensor is of dtype float32,
    but the ''A'' tensor is of dtype float64 (double). Therefore, the data type of
    ''out'' tensor should be corrected. Left : type(out), which is the data type of

    The input tensor type is Bool, and error message says it expects a floating point
