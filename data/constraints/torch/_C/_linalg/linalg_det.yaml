    or complex tensor as input, but an integer tensor is being provided. Let''s see
    what the args were. The ''A'' tensor is of type int32. Therefore, Left : A.dtype,
    which is the type of tensor A, should be corrected. It says that should be a floating
    point or complex tensor, so Op : ==, and Right : float or complex.'
  target: 'linalg.det: Expected a floating point or complex tensor as input. Got Short'
  txt: A.dtype == float or A.dtype == complex
- cot: 'The error is triggered because the "A" matrix is not a square matrix, which
    is required for the operation `linalg.det`. Let''s see what the args were. "A"
    was a tensor of float32 with dimensions [9, 8, 6, 8]. A square matrix requires
    that all dimensions be equal, but in this case, the dimensions of "A" are not
    equal. Therefore, to prevent this error from occurring again, we need to ensure
    that "A" is always a square matrix when passed to `linalg.det`.


    The constraint for the ''A'' parameter can be expressed as:'
  target: 'linalg.det: A must be batches of square matrices, but they are 6 by 8 matrices'
  txt: len(A.shape) >= 2 and A.shape[-1] == A.shape[-2]
- cot: 'The error arises because the function linalg.det requires the input tensor
    ''A'' to have at least 2 dimensions, but the current tensor ''A'' is of zero dimensions.
    Let''s see what the args were. The ''A'' tensor is of zero dimensions. Therefore,
    Left : len(A.shape), op : >=, right : 2.'
  target: 'linalg.det: The input tensor A must have at least 2 dimensions.'
  txt: len(A.shape)>=2
- cot: 'The error happens because the ''out'' tensor is of complex double type, but
    the function expects a float type. We need to ensure that the datatype of the
    ''out'' tensor matches the expected output type. So, the constraint for the ''out''
    tensor can be expressed as:'
  target: Expected out tensor to have dtype float, but got c10::complex<double> instead
  txt: out.dtype == A.dtype
- cot: 'The error is caused by the function "lu_cpu" which is not implemented for
    ''Half'' data type. The tensors ''A'' and ''out'' are both provided as float16,
    which is not compatible. So, the data types of ''A'' and ''out'' should be corrected
    to become compatible with the function. Op : !=, and Right : ''Half''.'
  target: '"lu_cpu" not implemented for ''Half'''
