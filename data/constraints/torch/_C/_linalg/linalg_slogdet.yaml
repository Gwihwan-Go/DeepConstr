- cot: 'The error is triggered because the input matrix is not square. Let''s see
    what the args were. Here, the dimensions of matrix A are 8 by 6. For a matrix
    to be square, the number of rows and columns must be equal. Therefore, to prevent
    this error from occurring in the future, we need to ensure that the last two dimensions
    of A are equal.


    The constraint for the ''A'' parameter can be expressed as:'
  target: 'linalg.slogdet: A must be batches of square matrices, but they are 8 by
    6 matrices'
  txt: A.shape[-2] == A.shape[-1]
- cot: 'Error is triggered because the input tensor A does not have at least 2 dimensions.
    Looking at the arguments, Tensor A is a zero-dimensional tensor as it has an empty
    shape. linalg.slogdet requires at least a 2D tensor. Therefore, the constraint
    is:'
  target: 'linalg.slogdet: The input tensor A must have at least 2 dimensions.'
  txt: len(A.shape) >= 2
- cot: Error is triggered because the input tensor is of type int16, while the linalg.slogdet
    function expects a tensor of floating point or complex type. Let's see what the
    args were. Here, the tensor 'A' is the problem. It should be converted to a floating
    point or complex tensor before being passed to the linalg.slogdet function. Therefore,
    the constraint should be that the dtype of 'A' must be floating point or complex.
    Hence,
  target: 'linalg.slogdet: Expected a floating point or complex tensor as input. Got
    Short'
  txt: A.dtype == tf.float32 or A.dtype == tf.float64 or A.dtype == tf.complex64 or
    A.dtype == tf.complex128
