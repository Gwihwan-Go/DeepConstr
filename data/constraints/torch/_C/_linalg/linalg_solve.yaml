- cot: This error occurs because the tensors 'A' and 'B' have different data types.
    'A' is a Double tensor while 'B' is a Float tensor. The 'linalg.solve' function
    expects 'A' and 'B' to have the same data type. The constraint to prevent this
    error is that the data types of the tensors 'A' and 'B' should be the same.
  target: 'linalg.solve: Expected A and B to have the same dtype, but found A of type
    Double and B of type Float instead'

- cot: 'The error message suggests that the data type of the ''out'' tensor is incorrect.
    The expected data type is float, but the actual type is complex. Therefore, the
    data type of the ''out'' tensor needs to be matched to the data type of the ''A''
    and ''B'' tensors. This can be done with the following constraints:'

    the ''Half'' data type. The keys ''A'', ''B'', and ''out'' in the given dictionary
    all have their tensors of data type ''float16'' which is also known as ''Half''.
    Therefore, to avoid this error, the data type of these tensors should be changed
    to a type that is supported by "lu_cpu". Therefore, type(A.dtype) should not be
    ''float16'', so Op : !=, and Right : ''float16''. Similarly, type(B.dtype) and

    \ to be an operation that requires these sizes to match but they do not. \n\n\
    To prevent this error, we need to ensure that the size of tensor 'B' at non-singleton\
    \ dimension 2 is equal to the size of tensor 'out' at non-singleton dimension\
    \ 2. This can be done in two ways:\n\n1. Resize tensor 'B' at non-singleton dimension\

    \ the size of tensor 'B' at this dimension from 8 to 4.\n\n2. Resize tensor 'out'\
    \ at non-singleton dimension 2 to match the size of tensor 'B' at this dimension.\
    \ This will involve increasing the size of tensor 'out' at this dimension from\
    \ 4 to 8.\n\nIn both scenarios, care should be taken to ensure that the resizing\
    \ operation preserves the necessary information and does not distort the tensor.\n\
