    prevent this error, ''x'' should not be a boolean tensor. Therefore, Left : x.dtype,
    Op : !=, Right : Bool.'
  target: linalg.vander supports floating point, complex, and integer tensors, but
    got Bool

- cot: 'The error is stating that the value for ''N'' must be greater than 1. The
    current value for ''N'' is 0, which is not satisfying this condition. So, the
