- cot: 'The error is due to the inconsistent dimensions of the ''input'' and ''weight''.
    Let''s see what the args were. It seems ''input'' is 0D tensor and ''weight''
    is 2D tensor. So, ''input'' and ''weight'' should be corrected. It says both arguments
    to matmul need to be at least 1D, so Operation : >=; and Right : 1'
  target: both arguments to matmul need to be at least 1D, but they are 0D and 2D
  txt: input.rank >= 1
- cot: 'The error is due to the mismatch of the shapes of ''input'' and ''weight''
    tensors. In matrix multiplication, the number of columns in the first matrix must
    be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. In this case, the shape of
    ''input'' is [8, 6] and ''weight'' is [9, 2]. The number of columns in ''input''
    (6) is not equal to the number of rows in ''weight'' (9), which is why the error
    is occurring. Let''s correct this. We need to ensure that input.shape[1] == weight.shape[0].
    Also, the ''bias'' tensor should have the same shape as the last dimension of
    ''weight'', i.e., weight.shape[1]. So, the constraints would be:'
  target: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (8x6 and 2x9)
  txt: (bias.shape[0]==input.shape[0]) or ((input.shape[1]==weight.shape[1]) and ((len(bias.shape)
    == 1 and bias.shape[0] == weight.shape[1]) and ((len(input.shape) == len(weight.shape))
    and (input.shape[1] == weight.shape[0]))))
- cot: 'The error is triggered because the sizes of tensor a and tensor b do not match
    at non-singleton dimension 9. From the given values, it seems that tensor ''bias''
    has more dimensions than the tensor ''input'' and ''weight''. Therefore, the dimensions
    of the ''bias'', ''input'' and ''weight'' should be the same to prevent the error.
    The related constraints could be:'
  target: The size of tensor a (6) must match the size of tensor b (2) at non-singleton
    dimension 9
  txt: bias[9] == weight[9]
- cot: 'The error arises from trying to transpose a tensor with more than 2 dimensions.
    The transpose operation ''t()'' only works with tensors that have 2 or fewer dimensions.
    Based on the given values, the ''weight'' tensor has 10 dimensions. Therefore,
    Left : len(weight.shape), which is the number of dimensions of weight tensor.
    Op : <=, and Right : 2, which is the maximum number of dimensions allowed by the
    transpose operation.'
  target: t() expects a tensor with <= 2 dimensions, but self is 10D
  txt: len(weight.shape)<=2
- cot: 'The error is caused due to mismatch in the datatypes of ''self'' and ''mat2''.
    Let''s see what the args were. It seems ''self'' was ''input'' and ''mat2'' was
    ''weight''. So, ''input.dtype'' and ''weight.dtype'' should be corrected. It says
    both should have the same dtype. So, Op: ==; and Right: ''input.dtype'''
  target: self and mat2 must have the same dtype, but got Float and Short

- cot: 'The error occurs because mat2 is expected to be a matrix, but a 1-D tensor
    is provided. In this case, ''weight'' is the 1-D tensor. Let''s see the what args
    were. The dimensions of ''weight'' should be equal to 2 to be considered as a
    matrix. Therefore, Left : len(weight.shape), Op : ==, Right : 2.'
  target: mat2 must be a matrix, got 1-D tensor
