rules:
- cot: 'The error is caused because the pad size is more than half of the kernel size.
    Let''s see what the args were. The kernel size is 2 and the padding size is 5.
    Therefore, the padding size should be less than or equal to half the kernel size.
    Therefore, left : padding, op : <=, right : kernel_size / 2'
  target: pad should be at most half of kernel size, but got pad=5 and kernel_size=2
  txt: padding <= kernel_size / 2
- cot: 'The error is caused because the ''kernel_size'' parameter is an empty list,
    while it is expected to be a single integer or a tuple of two integers. We can
    see from the provided values that ''kernel_size'' is currently an empty list [].
    Let''s generate the constraints to prevent this error. The ''kernel_size'' should
    either be a single integer or a tuple of two integers.


    Therefore, we have the following constraints:'
  target: 'avg_pool2d: kernel_size must either be a single int, or a tuple of two
    ints'
  txt: (len(padding) == 2) and (len(kernel_size)==1)
- cot: 'The error is triggered because the ''divisor_override'' value is set to 0,
    and in this context, the divisor must not be zero. Therefore, Left: ''divisor_override'',
    Op: ''!='', and Right: 0.'
  target: divisor must be not zero
  txt: divisor_override != 0
- cot: 'The error is triggered because the input tensor dimension is not 3D or 4D
    with optional 0 dim batch size. Looking at the error, it seems that the tensor
    has 9 dimensions, which is the issue. To correct this, we need the number of dimensions
    of the input tensor to be between 3 and 4 (inclusive). Therefore, Left : input.ndims(),
    Op : >=, and Right : 3. Also, Left : input.ndims(), Op : <=, and Right : 4. The
    0-dimension batch size seems to be optional. So the constraints would be:'
  target: Expected 3D or 4D (batch mode) tensor with optional 0 dim batch size for
    input, but got:[3, 6, 5, 1, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 8]
  txt: input.ndims() <= 4
- cot: 'The error occurs because the calculated output size is too small, specifically
    in the third dimension (10x1x0). This could be due to the kernel size being too
    large or the stride being too small. Let''s inspect the arguments. The kernel
    size is 15, which is greater than the size of the input in any dimension. Therefore,
    Left : kernel_size, op : <=, Right : min(input.size). Also, stride is 1 which
    is reasonable, but let''s make sure it''s less than the size of the input as well.
    Left : stride, op : <, Right : min(input.size). Finally, padding is 3, which should
    be less than or equal to the half of the smallest size of the input. Left : padding,
    op : <=, Right : min(input.size)/2.'
  target: 'Given input size: (10x9x8). Calculated output size: (10x1x0). Output size
    is too small'
  txt: kernel_size <= min(input.size)
- cot: 'The error is triggered because the kernel size is not as expected. The kernel
    size should be greater than zero, but it is currently set to zero. Therefore,
    the constraint should be that the kernel size is greater than zero. Let''s see
    what the args were. The ''kernel_size'' is 0 which should be corrected.


    Therefore, Left : kernel_size. Op : >, and Right : 0.'
  target: 'kernel size should be greater than zero, but got kH: 0 kW: 0'
  txt: kernel_size > 0
- cot: 'The error is triggered because the padding value is negative. Looking at the
    args, the padding value is set to -1, but it needs to be non-negative. Therefore,
    Left : padding. It cannot be negative, so Op : >=, and Right : 0.'
  target: 'pad must be non-negative, but got pad: -1'
  txt: padding>=0
