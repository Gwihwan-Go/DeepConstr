    ''Bool'' data types. From the provided values, ''input'', ''other'' and ''out''
    tensors are all of ''Bool'' data type. We should thus ensure that these tensors
    are not of ''Bool'' data type. Therefore, Left : type(''input''), type(''other''),

    \ one constraint could be that the dimensions of 'input' and 'other' must match.\
    \ \n\nThe 'out' tensor appears to be a scalar (no dimensions), which might be\
    \ intended to store some result of an operation involving 'input' and 'other'.\
    \ If this 'out' tensor is supposed to have the same dimensions as the result,\
    \ another constraint could be that its dimensions must match the result of the\
    \ operation. \n\nSo, constraints could be as follows:"
