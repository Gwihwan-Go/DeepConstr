  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-1, 0], but got 2)
  txt: dim >= -len(input.shape) and dim < len(input.shape)
- cot: 'The error is due to the mismatch in dimensions between the ''out'' tensor
    and the ''input'' tensor. The ''out'' tensor is of dimension [3, 2] while the
    ''input'' tensor is of dimension [9, 8]. The operation attempts to resize the
    ''out'' tensor to match the ''input'' tensor, but the ''out'' tensor is not resizable.
    To prevent this error, the dimensions of the ''out'' tensor should match the dimensions
    of the ''input'' tensor when the operation is performed. Therefore, the logical
    relationship constraint would be:'

  txt: out.shape == input.shape
- cot: 'The error message indicates that the input and output tensor data types do
    not match. The input tensor is of type Float32, while the output tensor is of
    type Float64. Therefore, the constraint is that the data type of the input tensor
    and the output tensor must be the same. Therefore, Left : input.dtype, Op : ==,
    Right : out.dtype'
  target: Expected the dtype for input and out to match, but got Float for input's
    dtype and Double for out's dtype.
