- cot: 'The error is occurring because the ''dim'' value is out of the expected range.
    The ''dim'' value should be within the range of [-4, 3] but the value provided
    is 4, which is out of range. Therefore, we need to ensure that the ''dim'' value
    is within the appropriate range. So, Left : dim, Op : >=, and Right : -4. Also,
    Left : dim, Op : <=, and Right : 3. Furthermore, dim should be an integer, so
    type(dim) should be int.'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-4, 3], but got 4)
  txt: dim >= -4 and dim <= 3
- cot: 'The error is triggered because the ''repeats'' tensor is not a 0-dim or 1-dim
    tensor as expected. Given the shape of the ''repeats'' tensor, it is not 0-dim
    or 1-dim. The dimension of ''repeats'' should be either 0 or 1. Therefore, Left
    : len(repeats.shape), Ops : in, and Right : [0, 1]'
  target: repeats must be 0-dim or 1-dim tensor
  txt: len(repeats.shape) in [0, 1]
- cot: 'This error is triggered due to negative dimensions in the ''dim'' argument
    and the ''repeats'' tensor. First, the ''dim'' argument has a value of -3, which
    is not allowed because dimensions cannot be negative. Second, the ''repeats''
    tensor also contains a negative value of -1228, which is also not allowed for
    the same reason. Therefore, both ''dim'' and ''repeats'' should be corrected to
    non-negative values. Let''s create constraints for these arguments.


    For ''dim'', Left : dim, Op : >=, and Right : 0. For ''repeats'', we need to ensure
    all elements in the tensor are non-negative. Therefore, Left : all(repeats), Op
    : >=, and Right : 0.'
  target: negative dimensions are not allowed
  txt: (dim < len(input.shape)) or (dim >= 0)
- cot: 'Error is triggered because the dimension is specified as -1 but the tensor
    has no dimensions. It seems the tensor should have at least one dimension to avoid
    this error. Let''s see what the args were. Given the input:Tensor and dim:0, it
    seems the tensor is missing dimensions. Therefore, Left : len(input). Because
    it needs at least one dimension, so Op : >, and Right : 0.'
  target: Dimension specified as -1 but tensor has no dimensions
  txt: len(input) > 0
- cot: 'The error is due to the ''repeat_interleave_cpu'' function not being implemented
    for ''Float''. The ''input'' and ''repeats'' tensors are both of float32 type

  target: '"repeat_interleave_cpu" not implemented for ''Float'''
  txt: type(input) != "Float" and type(repeats) != "Float"

- cot: 'The error arises from the ''repeats'' attribute of the tensor, which is of
    type float16 (Half). However, the function "repeat_interleave_cpu" is not implemented
    for tensors of type ''Half''. Therefore, the tensor type of ''repeats'' should
    be changed from ''Half'' to a compatible type. The Left : type(repeats), Op :

    The Op is ''>='', and the Right is ''0''. This implies that all values in the
    ''repeats'' tensor should be greater than or equal to 0. Hence, the constraint
    that would prevent this error from occurring again is as follows:'
  target: repeats can not be negative
  txt: all(repeats[i] >= 0 for i in range(len(repeats)))

  target: repeats must have the same size as input along dim
  txt: input.shape[dim] == repeats.shape[0]
- cot: The error is due to the use of an unsupported ScalarType 'BFloat16'. The tensor
    'repeats' is of type BFloat16 which might not be supported by the function or
    operation being performed. Therefore, the dtype of 'repeats' must be changed to
    a supported type. The constraint to be generated is to ensure that the dtype of
    all tensors involved in the operation are supported by that operation. The 'repeats'
    tensor should have a dtype that is supported by the operation.
