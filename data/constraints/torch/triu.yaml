- cot: 'Error is triggered because of trying to resize a tensor ''out'' that is not
    resizable. The shape of ''out'' tensor should match the shape of ''input'' tensor
    for the operation to be successful. Looking at the values, the shape of ''out''
    tensor is [8, 2, 6] and the shape of ''input'' tensor is [6, 8, 6, 6, 1, 3, 4,
    1, 3, 2]. These shapes are not the same, hence the error. Therefore, the constraints
    are left : out.shape, op : ==, right : input.shape'
  target: Trying to resize storage that is not resizable
  txt: all(out.shape[i]==input.shape[i] for i in range(len(input.shape)))
- cot: The error is triggered because the input tensor must have at least 2 dimensions
    for the "triu" function. Based on the provided values, the input tensor only has
    1 dimension. Therefore, the constraint should be that the length of the shape
    of the input tensor must be greater than or equal to 2.
  target: 'triu: input tensor must have at least 2 dimensions'
  txt: len(input.shape) >= 2
- cot: 'Based on the given values, the error arises because the output tensor ''out''
    data type is integer instead of float. Let''s see what the args were. The output
    tensor ''out'' data type is integer, but it is expected to be float. Therefore,
    Left : out.dtype, which is the type of tensor ''out'', should be corrected. It
    says that should be equal to the datatype of tensor ''input'', so Op : ==, and
    Right : input.dtype.'
  target: Expected out tensor to have dtype float, but got int instead
  txt: out.dtype==input.dtype
