- cot: The error is generated due to an attempt to resize a storage that is not resizable.
    The tensors 'input', 'other' and 'out' have different shapes. It's likely that
    one of these tensors is trying to be manipulated to match the shape of another.
    To avoid this error, we should ensure that the tensors are correctly ordered and
    that their dimensions align as expected. Therefore, the shapes of 'input', 'other',
    and 'out' should be the same or compatible depending on the operation.
