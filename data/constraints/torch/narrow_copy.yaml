- cot: 'The error arises because the function is trying to apply the narrow() operation
    on a 0-dimensional tensor, which is not valid. The ''dim'' parameter is -1, the
    ''input'' tensor is a 0-dimensional tensor, ''length'' is 6 and ''start'' is 7.
    The tensor needs to have at least 1 dimension to apply narrow(). Therefore, the
    rank of the ''input'' tensor should be more than 0. Also, the ''start'' value
    should be less than the dimension size of the ''input'' tensor along ''dim''.
    And the ''start'' value plus ''length'' should not exceed the dimension size of
    the ''input'' tensor along ''dim''. Therefore the constraints should be:'
  target: narrow() cannot be applied to a 0-dim tensor.
  txt: len(input.shape) > 0
- cot: 'The error is due to the dimension being out of range. The ''dim'' value provided
    is -5, but the valid range is from -4 to 3, based on the shape of the input tensor.
    We can see that the input tensor has 4 dimensions, hence the range [-4, 3]. Therefore,
    to prevent this error from occurring again, we need to ensure that the ''dim''
    value falls within the valid range. This can be achieved by ensuring that ''dim''
    is greater than or equal to negative of the length of the input shape, and less
    than the length of the input shape.


    The logical constraint for the ''dim'' parameter can be expressed as:'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-4, 3], but got -5)
  txt: dim >= -len(input.shape)
- cot: 'The error is due to the start value and length exceeding the dimension size
    of the input tensor. What the args were? Start is 6 and length is 6, which sums
    up to 12, but the size of the dimension is only 9. Therefore, Left : start + length,
    Op : <=, Right : dimension size.'
  target: start (6) + length (6) exceeds dimension size (9).
  txt: (start + length < input.shape[dim]) or ((start + length >= 0) and ((start +
    length <= dim) and (start + length <= input.shape[dim])))
- cot: 'The error is due to an invalid ''dim'' value. Let''s see what the arguments
    were. It seems that ''dim'' is 6, but the input tensor only has 3 dimensions.
    Therefore, ''dim'' should be less than the number of dimensions of the input tensor.
    So, ''dim'' should be less than the size of the input tensor''s shape, Operation
    : <, and Right : len(input.shape).'
  target: Expected dim < static_cast<int64_t>(self_sizes.size()) to be true, but got
    false.  (Could this error message be improved?  If so, please report an enhancement
    request to PyTorch.)
  txt: dim < len(input.shape)
