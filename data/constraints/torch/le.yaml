    \ complex128 type, which is likely triggering this error. Therefore, one constraint\
    \ would be to ensure the 'other' tensor is not of a complex data type. \n\nAnother\
    \ potential issue could be a mismatch between the dimensions of the 'input' and\
    \ 'out' tensors. While this error message doesn't directly point to this, it's\
    \ generally a good practice to ensure tensors operated on together have compatible\
    \ dimensions. \n\nSo the constraints could be: 'other' tensor dtype should not\
    \ be complex128, and 'input' tensor should have same dimensions as 'out' tensor."

    based on its properties. The properties show that ''input'' and ''out'' tensor
    are of float32 type and ''other'' tensor is of int32 type. The error might be
    caused by trying to change the dimensions of ''input'', ''other'', ''out'' tensor
    which are not resizable. Thus, it''s necessary to ensure that the dimensions of
    these tensors are not altered. This leads to constraints: ''input'' tensor, ''other''
    tensor, and ''out'' tensor should maintain their dimensions. Therefore, Left:
