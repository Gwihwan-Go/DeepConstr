- cot: 'The error is triggered because the ''std'' and ''var'' functions only support
    floating point and complex dtypes, but the ''input'' tensor is of dtype int32.
    Therefore, the ''input'' tensor dtype should be corrected. Additionally, the ''out''
    tensor is of dtype float32, which could be correct as it supports the floating
    point dtype. The constraints would then be:'
  target: std and var only support floating point and complex dtypes
  txt: input.dtype == float or input.dtype == complex
- cot: "The error is triggered because an attempt is being made to resize a storage\
    \ that is not resizable. Looking at the values given, 'input' is a Tensor of type\
    \ float32 with a dimension of [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7], 'dim' is 0, 'correction' is\
    \ -1, and 'keepdim' is False. The 'out' is also a Tensor of type float32 with\
    \ no specified dimensions. \n\nTo prevent this error, we must ensure that we are\
    \ not trying to resize a non-resizable tensor. \n\nConstraint 1: The input tensor\
    \ must be resizable, so Op : ==, and Right : Resizable."
  target: Trying to resize storage that is not resizable
  txt: (len(out.shape) == len(input.shape) and (correction >= 0))
- cot: 'The error is due to an out of range dimension from the provided args. The
    ''dim'' value is 4, but the expected range is between -1 and 0. So, ''dim'' should
    be corrected to be in the range of -1 to 0. Thus, Left : dim, Op : >= and Right
    : -1. Also, Left : dim, Op : <= and Right : 0.'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-1, 0], but got 4)
