- cot: 'The error is due to a mismatch in the Tensor dimensions when trying to resize
    storage. The dimensions of ''input'' and ''out'' tensors do not match the ''other''
    tensor. The ''other'' tensor has dimensions of [3, 10, 3], while the ''input''
    tensor has [3] and ''out'' tensor has [2]. Therefore, we need to ensure that the
    dimensions of the tensors are compatible for the operation. This means that the
    dimension of ''input'' and ''out'' should either match or be broadcastable to
    the dimension of ''other''. Therefore, Left : len(input.shape) == len(other.shape)
    and len(out.shape) == len(other.shape), Op : ==, and Right : True.'
  target: Trying to resize storage that is not resizable
  txt: (input.dtype == 'float32') or ((input.shape[0] == 3) and ((out.rank==input.rank
    and all(out.shape[i]==input.shape[i] for i in range(out.rank))) and ((out.rank==3)
    and ((len(out.shape) == len(other.shape)) or (len(input.shape) == len(other.shape))))))
- cot: 'The error message indicates that the ScalarType BFloat16 is not supported.
    Looking at the args, ''input'', ''other'', and ''out'' are all tensors of type
    BFloat16. Therefore, the data type of these tensors should be corrected. It says
    that BFloat16 is unsupported, so Op : !=, and Right : BFloat16.'
  target: Got unsupported ScalarType BFloat16
  txt: out.dtype != 'BFloat16'
- cot: 'Based on given values, Error is triggered because size of tensors at non-singleton
    dimension 1 doesn''t match. What the args were? the two tensors matching problem
    at non-singleton dimension looks like broadcasting request. Broadcasting in tensor
    operations requires that the trailing dimensions of the tensors are either 1 or
    the same. We start from the last dimension because broadcasting aligns dimensions
    from the end. Therefore, we can revise the constraints as follows:'
  target: The size of tensor a (6) must match the size of tensor b (8) at non-singleton
    dimension 1
  txt: all(input.shape[i] == other.shape[i] or input.shape[i] == 1 or other.shape[i]
    == 1 for i in range(-1, -min(len(input.shape), len(other.shape))-1, -1))
- cot: 'The error is due to the incompatibility of the ''Float'' data type with the
    ''bitwise_xor_cpu'' operation. The ''bitwise_xor_cpu'' operation is not defined
    for ''Float'' data type. So, the data type of ''input'' and ''other'' should not
    be ''Float''. Therefore, dtype of ''input'' and ''other'' can not be float. Therefore,
    Op : !=, and Right : float for ''input'' and ''other''. Also, the output tensor''s
    shape is not relevant here as the error is due to the datatype and not the dimensions
    or size.'
  target: '"bitwise_xor_cpu" not implemented for ''Float'''

- cot: 'The error is caused because the result type Float can''t be cast to the desired
    output type Int. The output tensor type is int32 and the other tensor type is
    float32. Therefore, the other tensor type should be changed to int32 to match
    the output tensor type. What the args were? The ''other'' tensor type is float32
    which should be changed to int32. Therefore, Left : other.dtype, Op : ==, Right
    : out.dtype'
  target: result type Float can't be cast to the desired output type Int
  txt: (other.dtype == out.dtype) or (other.dtype == 'int32')
