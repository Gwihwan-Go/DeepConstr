rules:
- cot: 'The error occurs because the dimension provided is out of the valid range.
    The given dimension is 4, which is out of the range of [-4, 3]. To prevent this
    error in the future and generate constraints that do not trigger it, we need to
    ensure that the "dim" value is always within the valid range for the given tensor.
    If we denote the shape of the tensor as n, the valid range for the dimension would
    be [-n, n-1].


    However, there is a special case for tensors with no dimensions (empty tensors),
    where the dim value can be -1 (default value when none specified) and it won''t
    trigger the error.


    So the complete constraints can be expressed as:'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-4, 3], but got 4)
  txt: (dim >= -len(input.shape) and dim < len(input.shape)) or (dim == -1 and len(input.shape)
    == 0)
