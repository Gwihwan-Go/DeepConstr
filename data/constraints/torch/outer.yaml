- cot: "The error seems to be caused by the fact that 'vec2' should be a 1-D tensor,\
    \ but a 10-D tensor was provided. Let's see what the args were. The provided 'vec2'\
    \ tensor has a rank of 10. \n\nTo avoid this error, we need to ensure that the\
    \ 'vec2' tensor is always 1-D. So the constraint for the 'vec2' parameter would\
    \ be to check its rank. \n\nThe logical relationship to prevent this error can\
    \ be expressed as:"
  target: 'outer: Expected 1-D argument vec2, but got 10-D'
  txt: (len(vec2.shape) == 1) and (input.ndims() == 1) and (len(vec2.shape) == 1)
- cot: The error appears to be due to an attempt to resize a Tensor storage that is
    not resizable. Looking at the provided values, we can see that 'input', 'out',
    and 'vec2' are all Tensors with different dimensions. The Tensor storage size
    is determined by the dimension of the Tensor, and hence cannot be resized arbitrarily.
    Therefore, to prevent this error, we must ensure that the dimensions of 'input',
    'out', and 'vec2' are not changed after they are initially defined. A possible
    constraint to ensure this could be making sure the lengths of 'input', 'out',
    and 'vec2' remain the same.
  target: Trying to resize storage that is not resizable
  txt: ((all(vec2.shape[i] == out.shape[i] for i in range(vec2.rank))) and (len(out)
    == 3)) or ((all(input.shape[i] == out.shape[i] for i in range(input.rank))) and
    (len(out) == 3)) or ((all(vec2.shape[i] == out.shape[i] for i in range(vec2.rank)))
    and (len(out) == 3))
