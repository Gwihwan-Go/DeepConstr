    ''input'' and ''other'' tensors should have a length of 3, but currently, they
    have a length of 7. Therefore, the size of dimension 0 in both ''input'' and ''other''
    tensors should be corrected. It indicates that so input[dim].len and other[dim].len
    should be 3. So, Op : ==, and Right : 3.'

    other.shape[dim] == 3))
- cot: 'The error is due to the invalid dimension value. The ''dim'' argument is 2,
    but the function expects it to be in the range of [-1, 0]. Therefore, the ''dim''
    value should be within the valid range. So, Left : dim, Op : >=, Right : -1, and

- cot: 'Error is triggered because size of tensors at non-singleton dimension 0 doesn''t
    match. What the args were? The two tensors matching problem at non-singleton dimension
    seems like a broadcasting request. Broadcasting in tensor operations requires
    that the dimensions of the tensors are either 1 or the same. We start from the
    last dimension because broadcasting aligns dimensions from the end. Therefore,
    we can revise the constraints as follows:'
  target: The size of tensor a (9) must match the size of tensor b (6) at non-singleton
    dimension 0
  txt: (all(input.shape[i] == other.shape[i] or input.shape[i] == 1 or other.shape[i]
    == 1 for i in range(min(len(input.shape), len(other.shape))))) and (input.shape[0]
    == other.shape[0])
- cot: "The error message indicates that the input tensors for the linalg.cross function\
    \ must have the same number of dimensions. Looking at the values provided, 'input'\
    \ has 4 dimensions, 'other' has 1 dimension, and 'out' has 4 dimensions. Therefore,\
    \ we need to ensure that 'input' and 'other' have the same number of dimensions\
    \ to avoid the error. \n\nTherefore, Left: len(input.shape), Op: '==', Right:\
    \ len(other.shape)."
  target: 'linalg.cross: inputs must have the same number of dimensions.'
