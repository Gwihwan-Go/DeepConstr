rules:
- cot: 'The error suggests that there''s an attempt to resize a tensor that isn''t
    allowed to be resized. Considering the given values, it can be seen that ''input''
    tensor and ''out'' tensor have different dimensions. Therefore, an attempt to
    reshape or resize one into the other can potentially cause this error. To prevent
    this, a logical relationship constraint can be defined to ensure the dimensions
    of ''input'' and ''out'' tensors are always the same. Therefore, Left: ''input''.shape,
    Op: ''=='', and Right: ''out''.shape.'
  target: Trying to resize storage that is not resizable
  txt: '''input''.shape == ''out''.shape'
