rules:
- cot: 'The error is related to the ''signbit'' function not supporting non-boolean
    outputs. Here, the out tensor has a float32 datatype, which is not boolean. One
    possible way to prevent this error is to ensure that the ''out'' tensor has a
    boolean datatype. Therefore, Left : out.dtype, Op : ==, Right : bool.'
  target: signbit does not support non-boolean outputs.
  txt: out.dtype == bool
- cot: The error is due to trying to resize a storage that is not resizable. It is
    likely that the 'input' tensor and 'out' tensor have incompatible dimensions.
    Therefore, the dimensions of the 'out' tensor should match the dimensions of the
    'input' tensor to prevent this error.
  target: Trying to resize storage that is not resizable
  txt: input.shape == out.shape
