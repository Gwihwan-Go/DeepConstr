rules:
- cot: 'The error is happening because the value of ''dim1'' is 8, which falls outside
    the expected range of [-5, 4]. Based on the range condition stated in the error
    message, any value assigned for ''dim1'' should comply with this range. Therefore,
    the condition is that ''dim1'' should be greater than or equal to -5 and ''dim1''
    should be less than or equal to 4. The same logic applies to the value ''offset''.
    Based on the tensor dimensions for ''input'', the expected range is from -5 to
    4. Therefore we derive constraints that ''offset'' must in between -5 and 4. But
    ''offset'' is 4 itself, fitting the upper bound limit of the range. Hence the
    constraints we formed Live: dim1 >= -5;dim1 <= 4;offset >= -5;offset <= 4'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-5, 4], but got 8)
  txt: (dim2 == 0) and (((dim1 <= 0)) and (dim1 >= -5))
- cot: The error arises because the dimensions for the diagonal function are identical.
    The diagonal function expects distinct dimensions to generate a diagonal tensor.
    Let's see what the args were. 'dim1' and 'dim2' are both set to -5 and 2 respectively.
    Therefore, the 'dim1' and 'dim2' arguments must not be identical. So the logical
    relationship is that 'dim1' does not equal 'dim2'.
  target: diagonal dimensions cannot be identical -5, 2
  txt: dim1!=dim2
