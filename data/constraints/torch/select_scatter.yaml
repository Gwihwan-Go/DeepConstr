rules:
- cot: 'The error occurs because the ''index'' value (9) is greater than the size
    of the ''input'' tensor at dimension 0 (8). To prevent this error, you need to
    ensure that the ''index'' is always less than the size of the ''input'' tensor
    at the specified dimension. The ''dim'' value indicates the dimension to consider,
    which is 0 in this case.


    For the given values, the constraints could be:'
  target: 'select(): index 9 out of range for tensor of size [8, 6, 8, 6] at dimension
    0'
  txt: '''index'' < input.dim'
- cot: 'The error indicates that the "dim" value is out of the expected range. The
    range is defined by the dimensions of the input tensor. The ''dim'' value seems
    to be larger than the rank of the input tensor. So, we need to ensure that the
    ''dim'' value is in the range of the tensor rank. The constraints we can define
    are:


    1. ''dim'' should be greater than or equal to negative of the rank of the input
    tensor. So, left : dim, op : >=, right : -input.rank, -1.


    2. ''dim'' should be less than the rank of the input tensor. So, left : dim, op
    : <, right : input.rank, 1.


    Therefore, the constraints can be written as:'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-1, 0], but got 7)
  txt: (dim in [-1, 0]) and (input.rank == src.rank)
