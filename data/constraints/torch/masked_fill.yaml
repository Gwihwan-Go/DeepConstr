- cot: 'Error is triggered because size of tensors at non-singleton dimension 3 doesn''t
    match. Looking at the args, the tensors ''input'' and ''mask'' have mismatched
    sizes at non-singleton dimension 3. Broadcasting in tensor operations requires
    that the trailing dimensions of the tensors are either 1 or the same. We start
    from the last dimension because broadcasting aligns dimensions from the end. Given
    the tensor ''input'' and ''mask'', we can revise the constraints as follows:'
  target: The size of tensor a (2) must match the size of tensor b (8) at non-singleton
    dimension 3
  txt: all(input.shape[i] == mask.shape[i] or input.shape[i] == 1 or mask.shape[i]
    == 1 for i in range(-1, -min(len(input.shape), len(mask.shape))-1, -1))
- cot: 'The error occurs because the ''mask'' is a float data type, while the ''masked_fill_''
    function only supports boolean masks. Let''s examine the args. It appears that
    ''mask'' is a Tensor of type float. Therefore, ''mask'' should be corrected. It
    is stated that the ''mask'' should be of boolean type. So, Operation : == ; and
    Right : Boolean data type.'
  target: masked_fill_ only supports boolean masks, but got mask with dtype float
  txt: type(mask) == bool
