- cot: "The error occurs because the dimension provided, 2, is out of the valid range\
    \ for the 'input' tensor which is [-1, 0]. The 'input' tensor has a shape of [1],\
    \ meaning it has only one dimension, so the valid indices for its dimensions would\

    \ that do not trigger it, we need to ensure that the \"dims\" value is always\
    \ within the valid range for the given tensor. \n\nThe constraint for the 'dims'\
