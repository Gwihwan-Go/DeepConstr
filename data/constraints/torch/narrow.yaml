- cot: 'The error is due to the attempt to apply the narrow() function to a tensor
    that has 0 dimension. Narrow() function requires the tensor to have at least one
    dimension. What the args were? The ''dim'' value is 0, ''input'' is a tensor with
    0 dimension, ''length'' is 0, and ''start'' is an integer tensor. Therefore, the
    ''input'' tensor should have at least one dimension. So, Left : input.dim, which
    is the number of dimensions in the input tensor, should be greater than 0. So,
    Op : >, and Right : 0.'
  target: narrow() cannot be applied to a 0-dim tensor.
