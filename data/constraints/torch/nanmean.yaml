    that is not resizable. According to the provided values, the ''dim'' is 0 and
    ''input'' tensor size is [7, 8], while the ''out'' tensor size is [2, 1]. This
    indicates that the ''out'' tensor size does not match the ''input'' tensor size.
    Therefore, the dimensions of ''input'' and ''out'' must be equal to prevent this
