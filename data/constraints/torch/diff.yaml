- cot: 'The error message indicates that the ''prepend'' or ''append'' tensors are
    not the same dimension as the ''input'' tensor. In the provided values, ''input''
    tensor has 2 dimensions, ''prepend'' tensor has 4 dimensions, and ''append'' tensor
    has 0 dimensions. The dimension of ''prepend'' or ''append'' tensor should be
    equal to the dimension of ''input'' tensor. Therefore, the constraint should be
    Left : ''prepend''.rank or ''append''.rank, Op : ==, and Right : ''input''.rank.'
  target: diff expects prepend or append to be the same dimension as input
  txt: (('prepend'.rank == 'input'.rank)) and (('append'.rank == 'input'.rank))
- cot: 'Based on the error message, the dimensions of the ''prepend'' tensor and the
    ''input'' tensor do not match. The ''prepend'' tensor''s size at dimension 0 is
    4, while the ''input'' tensor''s size at dimension 0 is 10. The shapes of these
    tensors should match except for the differencing dimension. Therefore, the constraint
    to prevent this error is as follows. Left: input.size(0), Op: ==, Right: prepend.size(0)
    and input.size(0), Op: ==, Right: append.size(0).'
  target: diff expects the shape of tensor to prepend or append to match that of input
    except along the differencing dimension; input.size(0) = 10, but got tensor.size(0)
    = 4
  txt: (prepend.size(1) == input.size(1)) and (input.size(0) == append.size(0))
- cot: 'The error is due to the ''dim'' value being out of the expected range. The
    expected range is [-1, 0], but the ''dim'' value is 1. Let''s see what the args
    were. ''dim'' value is the problem and should be corrected to be either -1 or
    0. Therefore, Left : dim. Since the expected values are -1 or 0, so Op : ==, and
    Right : -1 or 0. Also, It implies that dimension cannot be 1, so Op : !=, and
    Right : 1.'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-1, 0], but got 1)
