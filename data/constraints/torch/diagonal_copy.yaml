rules:
- cot: 'The error suggests that the diagonal dimensions cannot be identical for dim1
    and dim2. It means the values assigned to dim1 and dim2 must not be identical.
    Therefore, Left : dim1, Right : dim2, the operation between dim1 and dim2 should
    be not equals to, so Op : !=.'
  target: diagonal dimensions cannot be identical -1, 0
  txt: (len(input) > 0) and (dim1 != dim2) and (len(input) > 0)
- cot: The error is due to an out-of-range dimension. Looking at the arguments, it
    seems 'dim1' is the dimension in question, and its value is 2. The error message
    indicates that the valid range of dimensions is between -1 and 0. Therefore, we
    can state the constraint that 'dim1' should be within this range. So, the operation
    is '>= and <=', and the right values are '-1 and 0' respectively.
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-1, 0], but got 2)
  txt: (-1<=dim2 and dim2<=0) and (-1<=dim1 and dim1<=0)
