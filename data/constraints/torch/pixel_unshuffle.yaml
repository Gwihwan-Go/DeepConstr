- cot: 'The error occurs because the width of the input tensor is not divisible by
    the downscale_factor. It is expected that the width of the input tensor, which
    is the last element of the tensor''s shape, should be divisible by the downscale_factor.
    Given the constraint, this is the logical relationship. Left : input.size(-1)
    % downscale_factor, op : ==, right : 0.'
  target: pixel_unshuffle expects width to be divisible by downscale_factor, but input.size(-1)=9
    is not divisible by 2
  txt: input.size(-1) % downscale_factor == 0
- cot: 'The error is due to insufficient number of dimensions. What the args were?
    The function ''pixel_unshuffle'' is expecting an input with at least 3 dimensions,
    but the input tensor only has 2 dimensions. Therefore, Left : input.rank, which
    is the number of dimensions of the input tensor. It says that it must be at least
    3, so Op : >=, and Right : 3.'
  target: pixel_unshuffle expects input to have at least 3 dimensions, but got input
    with 2 dimension(s)
  txt: input.rank>=3
- cot: 'The error occurs because the ''downscale_factor'' value provided is not valid
    for the ''pixel_unshuffle'' function. From the error message, it can be inferred
    that the ''downscale_factor'' should be positive. So, we need to ensure that ''downscale_factor''
    is greater than 0.


    The constraint for the ''downscale_factor'' parameter can be expressed as:'
  target: pixel_unshuffle expects a positive downscale_factor, but got 0
  txt: downscale_factor > 0
