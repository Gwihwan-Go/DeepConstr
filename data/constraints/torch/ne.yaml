- cot: 'The error is due to attempt to resize a tensor that is not resizable. It is
    important to ensure that the ''input'', ''other'', and ''out'' tensors have proper
    dimensions that align with the operations to be performed. Here, the ''input''
    tensor has dimensions [1, 1, 8] while ''other'' and ''out'' tensor has no dimensions

    The constraint here would be to ensure that ''other'' and ''out'' tensors have
    the same dimensions as ''input'' tensor. This can be achieved by checking the
    length and shape of these tensors before performing any operation. Therefore,
    Left : len(other) == len(input) and len(out) == len(input), Op : == , and Right
    : True.'
