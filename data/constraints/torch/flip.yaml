rules:
- cot: 'The error is due to an out-of-range dimension value. The ''dims'' value is
    11, but the valid range for dimensions, considering the input tensor''s rank (length
    of the shape), is between -10 and 9. The tensor has 10 dimensions (from 0 to 9),
    so trying to access the 11th dimension causes an error. Therefore, the ''dims''
    value should be a valid index of the tensor''s dimensions. The constraints we
    need to set are: `dims[i]` should be >= -len(input.shape) and < len(input.shape)
    for each i in range(len(dims)).'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-10, 9], but got 11)
  txt: all(dims[i] >= -len(input.shape) and dims[i] < len(input.shape) for i in range(len(dims)))
- cot: The error is triggered because the 'dims' list contains multiple occurrence
    of the same value, in this case '5'. The duplicates in 'dims' list should be removed
    to prevent the error. A constraint could be generated to ensure unique elements
    in the 'dims' list. Additionally, the 'dims' list should only contain values that
    are within the range of the length of 'input' tensor's shape .
  target: dim 5 appears multiple times in the list of dims
  txt: all([i>=0 and i < len(input.shape) for i in dims])
