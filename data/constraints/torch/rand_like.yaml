- cot: 'The error is due to using a ''Bool'' type tensor for a function "check_uniform_bounds"
    that doesn''t support ''Bool'' type. The input tensor is boolean, but it should
    be in a format that the function can process. So, the data type of the ''input''
    tensor should be corrected. The Left : input.dtype. It is not defined what type
    is expected, but it''s clear that ''Bool'' is not acceptable. So, Op : !=, and
    Right : Bool. Also, it is mentioned that ''requires_grad'' is set to ''True'',
    which usually requires the tensor to be of a float type. Hence, Op : ==, and Right
    : float.'
