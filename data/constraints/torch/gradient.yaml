- cot: 'The error occurs because the dimension provided is out of the valid range.
    Looking at the values, the ''dim'' value is -11 which is out of the expected range
    of [-5, 4]. The dimension value is based on the rank of the input tensor. In this
    case, the rank of the tensor is 5 (as the shape of ''input'' is [7, 2, 4, 7, 1]).


    To prevent this error in the future and generate constraints that do not trigger
    it, we need to ensure that the ''dim'' value is always within the valid range
    for the given tensor. That is, it should always be greater than or equal to negative
    of the number of dimensions and less than the number of dimensions.


    The constraint for the ''dim'' parameter can be expressed as:'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-5, 4], but got -11)
  txt: dim >= -len(input.shape) and dim < len(input.shape)
- cot: 'Based on the error message, it seems like the ''edge_order'' value is not
    supported by torch.gradient function. It only accepts the values 1 and 2. Here,
    the ''edge_order'' value is 8, which is causing the error. Therefore, to prevent
    this error, we need to ensure that the ''edge_order'' is either 1 or 2. Thus,
    the logical relationship constraints would be:'
  target: torch.gradient only supports edge_order=1 and edge_order=2.
  txt: (edge_order == 1) or (edge_order == 2) or (edge_order == 1)
- cot: 'The error occurs because the dimension size is less than edge_order+1. Let''s
    see what the args were. It seems the input tensor''s dimension size should be
    greater than or equal to edge_order+1. Therefore, we can express this constraint
    as:'
  target: torch.gradient expected each dimension size to be at least edge_order+1
  txt: input.shape[dim] >= edge_order + 1
