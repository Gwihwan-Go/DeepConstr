- cot: The error indicates that there is an attempt to resize a storage that is not
    resizable. The constraint can be that the 'input', 'other', and 'out' arguments
    should be tensors that match the size defined in the error. Therefore, the tensor
    'input' size should be [4], 'other' size should be [10, 1, 2, 2, 6, 3, 1, 3, 4],
    and 'out' size should be [9, 9, 3].
  target: Trying to resize storage that is not resizable
  txt: (other.rank == input.rank and all(other.shape[i] == input.shape[i] for i in
    range(other.rank))) and ((out.shape == input.shape) and (len(out) == 3))
- cot: 'The error occurs because the function "gcd_cpu" is not implemented for ''Float''
    values. The function is called with input, other, and out tensors which are all
    of type float32. In order to prevent this error from occurring again, the type
    of these tensors should be corrected to types that are compatible with the "gcd_cpu"
    function. The constraint to check the type of these tensors should be as follows:'
  target: '"gcd_cpu" not implemented for ''Float'''
  txt: (input.dtype != 'Float') or (out.dtype in ["int16", "int32", "int64", "uint8",
    "uint16", "uint32", "uint64"]) or (input.dtype != 'Float')
- cot: 'The problem is with the casting of the result type. The output tensor type
    is int8 (''Char'') but the operation result is float32 which cannot be casted
    to int8. Therefore, Left : ''out'' tensor dtype, Op : ==, Right : ''other'' tensor
    dtype'
  target: result type Float can't be cast to the desired output type Char
