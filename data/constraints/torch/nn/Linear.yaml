- cot: 'The error is due to the inconsistency in the tensor dimensions for matrix
    multiplication. Let''s see what the args were. It seems that ''in_features'' and
    ''out_features'' are set to 0, and the ''input'' tensor has a shape of [2]. In
    matrix multiplication, the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal
    to the number of rows in the second matrix. Here, ''in_features'' should match
    the last dimension of ''input'', and ''out_features'' should determine the shape
    of the resulting matrix. To prevent this error, the following constraints should
    be considered:'
  target: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (1x9 and 1x3)
  txt: ('in_features' == 'out_features') and ((in_features==input[-1]) and (out_features
    > 0))
- cot: 'The error message indicates that an invalid index was used to access an array.
    This could be due to the ''in_features'' value being set to 0. In this case, the
    input tensor has an empty shape. The ''bias'' value doesn''t seem to be causing
    the issue as it is set to True. To prevent this error, ensure that ''in_features''
    is greater than 0 and that the input tensor has at least one dimension. Thus,
    the constraints are as follows, Left : in_features, Op : >, Right : 0 and Left
    : len(input.shape), Op : >, Right : 0.'
  target: 'ArrayRef: invalid index Index = 18446744073709551615; Length = 0'
  txt: len(input.shape) > 0
- cot: 'The error occurs because the data types of m1 and m2 are not the same. The
    ''input'' tensor has dtype int8 (signed char), but the linear layer seems to expect
    a float dtype because ''bias'' is set to False. To prevent this error, we need
    to ensure that the input tensor has the same dtype as the layer expects. This
    can be achieved by converting the tensor''s dtype before passing it to the layer.


    The constraint can be expressed as:'
  target: 'expected m1 and m2 to have the same dtype, but got: signed char != float'
  txt: input.dtype == torch.float
