- cot: 'The error is because the ''p'' value is outside the valid range of 0 to 1.
    From the arguments, it''s clear that ''p'' is the dropout probability and currently
    has a value of 6.71625848841518. Therefore, ''p'' should be corrected. It has
    to be between 0 and 1, so Operation : >= and <=; Right : 0 and 1 respectively.'
  target: dropout probability has to be between 0 and 1, but got 6.71625848841518
