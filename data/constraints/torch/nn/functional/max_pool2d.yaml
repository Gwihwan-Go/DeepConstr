rules:
- cot: 'The error message indicates that the ''kernel_size'' must be either a single
    integer or a tuple of two integers. In the given values, ''kernel_size'' is an
    empty list, which is incorrect. Also, the ''stride'' value is negative, which
    is not acceptable because the stride value should be greater than 0. Therefore,
    the constraints should be that the ''kernel_size'' must be an integer or a tuple
    of two integers, and the ''stride'' value must be greater than 0. So, Left: type(kernel_size),
    Op: ''=='' and Right: int or tuple of two ints; Left: stride, Op: ''>'', Right:
    0.'
  target: 'max_pool2d: kernel_size must either be a single int, or a tuple of two
    ints'
  txt: (len(padding) == 1) and ((len(stride)==2) and ((kernel_size[0] > 0) or (len(kernel_size)
    == 2)))
- cot: 'The error occurs because the padding value is more than half of the kernel
    size. Let''s see what the args were. It appears that the padding is 500 and the
    kernel size is 1. Therefore, to resolve this issue and prevent this error from
    occurring again in the future, we need to ensure that the padding is at most half
    the kernel size.


    The constraints can be expressed as:'
  target: pad should be at most half of kernel size, but got pad=500 and kernel_size=500
  txt: (stride[0] <= input.shape[1]) or (padding <= max(kernel_size)/2)
- cot: Error is triggered because the input tensor is neither a 3D nor a 4D tensor.
    To avoid this error, the input tensor should always be a 3D or 4D tensor. Therefore,
    one constraint could be that the dimension of the input tensor, input.dim(), must
    be either 3 or 4.
  target: non-empty 3D or 4D (batch mode) tensor expected for input
  txt: input.dim() == 3
- cot: 'Error is triggered because of negative padding value in the input. Let''s
    see what the args were. It seems padding has negative value -500. Therefore, Left
    : padding[i], where i in range(len(padding)). It implies that negative values
    are problem., so Op : >=, and Right : 0.'
  target: 'pad must be non-negative, but got pad: -500'
  txt: all(padding[i] >= 0 for i in range(len(padding)))
