- cot: 'Error is triggered because the ''stride'' argument in max_pool1d() function
    is expected to contain one integer, but it contains 3. Let''s see what the args
    were. The ''stride'' arg contains 3 values [16, 17, 18], which is the problem.
    So the length of ''stride'' should be corrected, which is len(stride). Therefore,
    Left : len(stride). It says that should contain one int, so Op : ==, and Right
    : 1.'
  target: max_pool1d() argument 'stride' should contain one int (got 3)
  txt: len(stride) == 1
- cot: "In addition to the stride being greater than 0, we must also ensure that the\
    \ kernel_size is greater than 0. The kernel_size cannot be 0 as it defines the\
    \ number of units to be pooled together at a time. Furthermore, the stride, which\
    \ defines the step size over the input that the pooling operation is performed,\
    \ cannot be an empty list as it was in the provided values. \n\nTherefore, the\
    \ constraints to prevent the error are as follows:\n\n1. Kernel_size must be greater\
    \ than 0, so Op : >, and Right : 0.\n2. Stride must not be an empty list, so Op\
    \ : !=, and Right : []."
  target: stride should not be zero
  txt: ((stride != 0) and ((len(stride)>0) or (kernel_size > 0))) or (stride > 0)
    or ((stride != 0) and ((len(stride)>0) or (kernel_size > 0)))
- cot: Error is triggered because of the calculated output size being too small. Let's
    see what the args were. The input size is (2x1x6) and kernel_size is [39] and
    output size is (2x1x0). So the problem is that the kernel size is greater than
    the input size, causing the output size to be 0. Therefore,
  target: 'Given input size: (2x1x6). Calculated output size: (2x1x0). Output size
    is too small'
  txt: kernel_size <= input_size
- cot: 'Error is triggered because of 0-dimensional tensor. It expects to have 2 or
    3 dimensions. Let''s see what the args were. It seems ''input'' has 0 dimension,
    and is the problem. So, the number of dimensions of ''input'' should be corrected,
    which is ''input''.ndims(). Therefore, Left : ''input''.ndims(). It says that
    expected 2 to 3, so Op : ==, and Right : 2 or 3. Also, It implies that dimension
    cannot be 0, so Op : !=, and Right : 0.'

    ''self'' (while checking arguments for max_pool1d)'

- cot: 'Based on the error message, the error is triggered because the padding is
    more than half of the kernel size. However, it appears there is an additional
    error because the kernel size is negative which is not acceptable. The rules to
    be generated are as follows. Let''s see what the args were. The kernel size is
    ''-500'' and padding is ''4''. So, the kernel size should be corrected to be greater
    than zero and to be at least twice of padding. Therefore, Left : kernel_size.
    Op : >, Right : 0. and Left : kernel_size. Op: >=. Right : padding * 2'
  target: pad should be at most half of kernel size, but got pad=4 and kernel_size=-500
  txt: kernel_size >= padding * 2
- cot: 'The error is related to the ''padding'' value, which is -1, but it is expected
    to be non-negative. So, looking at the args, the Left : padding. The operator
    should be ''>='', and Right : 0. This means that the padding must be greater or
    equal to 0.'
  target: 'pad must be non-negative, but got pad: -1'
  txt: padding>=0
- cot: 'The error arises because the dilation value is not as expected. Let''s take
    a look at the args. The error message indicates that dilation should be greater
    than zero, but got a dilation value of 0. Therefore, Left : dilation. It says
    the dilation value should be greater than 0, so Op : >, and Right : 0.'
  target: 'dilation should be greater than zero, but got dilationH: 1 dilationW: 0'
  txt: dilation > 0
- cot: 'The error is due to an invalid value for ''kernel_size''. Let''s see what
    the args were. It appears that ''kernel_size'' is 0, which is not greater than
    zero. Therefore, ''kernel_size'' should be corrected. It says it should be greater
    than zero, so Operation : >; and Right : 0.'
