- cot: 'The error is due to the ''input'' data type being incompatible with the "hardsigmoid_cpu"
    operation. In this case, the ''input'' tensor data type is ''Int32'', which is
    not supported by the "hardsigmoid_cpu" operation. The ''inplace'' argument is
    set to ''True'', which indicates that the operation should be performed in-place
    on the ''input'' tensor. Therefore, the data type of ''input'' should be changed
    to a type that is compatible with "hardsigmoid_cpu". The ''inplace'' argument
    should also be checked to make sure that it is appropriate for the operation and
    the data type of the ''input'' tensor. The constraint could be:'
