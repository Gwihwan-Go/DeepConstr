rules:
- cot: 'The error is due to an out of range dimension. The ''dim'' value is 5 which
    is not in the expected range of [-2, 1]. Therefore, the ''dim'' value should be
    in the range [-2, 1]. Also, the ''_stacklevel'' value should be less than the
    length of the input shape. Hence, ''_stacklevel'' < len(''input''.shape). The
    tensor ''input'' has a dimension of [10, 9], so ''dim'' should be less than len(''input''.shape)
    which is 2. Therefore, the constraints should be:'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-2, 1], but got 5)
