- cot: 'The error is due to the invalid ''p'' value. Let''s see what the args were.
    It appears that ''p'' is the dropout probability and it''s currently -1.4678893,
    which is outside the valid range of 0 to 1. Therefore, ''p'' should be corrected.
    It says it should fall between 0 and 1, so Operation : >= and <=; and Right :
    0 and 1 respectively.'
  target: dropout probability has to be between 0 and 1, but got -1.4678893
