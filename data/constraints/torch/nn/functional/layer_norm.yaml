- cot: 'The error message indicates that the ''normalized_shape'' argument in the
    layer_norm() function is expected to be a tuple of integers, but an integer was
    received instead. In the given values, ''normalized_shape'' is 7, which is an
    integer, not a tuple. Therefore, the type of ''normalized_shape'' needs to be
    changed to a tuple. So, Left : type(normalized_shape), Op : ==, Right : tuple.'
  target: 'layer_norm(): argument ''normalized_shape'' (position 2) must be tuple
    of ints, not int'
  txt: type(normalized_shape) == tuple
- cot: The error is caused because the shape of the 'weight' tensor does not match
    the 'normalized_shape'. The 'weight' tensor has a shape of [8, 8] while the 'normalized_shape'
    is [2]. Hence, the constraint should be that the shape of 'weight' should be equal
    to the 'normalized_shape'. The operation is '=='.
  target: Expected weight to be of same shape as normalized_shape, but got weight
    of shape [6, 9, 10] and normalized_shape = [11]
  txt: (bias.shape == normalized_shape) and (weight.shape == normalized_shape)
- cot: "The error is occurring because the input tensor doesn't match the expected\
    \ shape. The normalized_shape is [5, 10], which means it expects an input with\
    \ the shape [*, 5, 10]. But the current input has a shape of [10]. Therefore,\
    \ the dimensions of the input tensor should be corrected. \n\nThe constraint can\
    \ be expressed as follows:"
  target: Given normalized_shape=[5, 10], expected input with shape [*, 5, 10], but
    got input of size[10]
  txt: input.shape == normalized_shape
- cot: 'The error is caused because the tensor type ''bias'' is Bool while the operation
    expects it to be of type Float. Therefore, the type of ''bias'' should be Float.
    Left : bias.dtype, Op : ==, Right : Float.'
  target: expected scalar type Float but found Bool
  txt: bias.dtype == Float
- cot: 'The error is triggered because all inputs do not share the same datatype.
    Looking at the args, bias and weight are of dtype float32, while input is of dtype
    complex64. The constraint here is that all input tensors must have the same datatype.
    Therefore, the Left : bias.dtype, Ops : ''=='', Right : input.dtype and Left :
    weight.dtype, Ops : ''=='', Right : input.dtype should be corrected to ensure
    all tensors have the same datatype.'

- cot: 'The error "LayerNormKernelImpl" not implemented for ''Int'' is due to the
    input of the function. It is trying to use ''Int'' for ''LayerNormKernelImpl''
    which is not implemented. Therefore, we need to correct the type of ''input''
    and ''weight'' to be ''float'' instead of ''int''. Therefore, Left : input.dtype
    and weight.dtype, Op : ==, and Right : float.'
