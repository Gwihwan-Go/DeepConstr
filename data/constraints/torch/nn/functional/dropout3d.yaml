- cot: 'The error is caused by an invalid ''p'' value. Checking the arguments, ''p''
    is the dropout probability and it''s currently -0.6139138, which falls outside
    the valid range of 0 to 1. Therefore, ''p'' needs to be corrected. It should fall
    between 0 and 1, so Operation : >= and <=; and Right : 0 and 1 respectively.'
  target: dropout probability has to be between 0 and 1, but got -0.6139138
  txt: (0<=p) and (p<=1) and (0<=p)
