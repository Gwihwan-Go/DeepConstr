- cot: 'The error occurred due to the ''dim'' value which is 4. The dimension value
    is expected to be in the range of [-3, 2] as per the error message. Therefore,
    the ''dim'' value should be corrected to fall within this range. So, left: ''dim'',
    op: ''in'', right: range(-3, 3).'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-3, 2], but got 4)
  txt: '''dim'' in range(-3, 3)'
- cot: "The error arises because the negative operator '-' is not supported on a boolean\
    \ tensor. Instead, the bitwise negation operator '~' or the function 'logical_not()'\
    \ can be used to invert a boolean tensor. Let's see what the args were. We have\
    \ a boolean tensor as input and dim = 7. The error message suggests that we should\
    \ use the '~' operator or 'logical_not()' function for boolean tensors.\nTherefore,\
    \ \n\n1. If 'input' is of boolean type, we should use '~' operator or 'logical_not()'\
    \ function instead of '-' operator."
  target: Negation, the `-` operator, on a bool tensor is not supported. If you are
    trying to invert a mask, use the `~` or `logical_not()` operator instead.
  txt: dim < len(input.shape)
- cot: 'The error is triggered because the softmax_lastdim_kernel_impl function doesn''t
    support ''ComplexDouble'' data type. Looking at the input values, the ''input''
    tensor has a data type of complex128, which is equivalent to ''ComplexDouble''.
    Therefore, the data type of the ''input'' tensor should be corrected. Let''s denote
    it as input.dtype(). Therefore, Left : input.dtype(). The operation should not
    equal ComplexDouble, so Op : !=, and Right : ComplexDouble.'
  target: '"softmax_lastdim_kernel_impl" not implemented for ''ComplexDouble'''
  txt: input.dtype() != ComplexDouble
- cot: "The error is because the 'softmax_lastdim_kernel_impl' is not implemented\
    \ for integer type. Looking at the args, the 'input' tensor is of 'Int' dtype\
    \ which is not supported. Therefore, the dtype of 'input' tensor needs to be corrected.\
    \ So, Left : input.dtype. And since the function is not implemented for 'Int',\
    \ it implies Op : !=, and Right : 'Int'. It should be some type which is supported\
