- cot: 'The error is caused because the padding values are too large, resulting in
    more than one wrap around. This can be avoided by ensuring that the padding values
    are less than the size of the input tensor in the corresponding dimensions. In
    this case, the input tensor has dimensions [4, 1, 3, 2], and the padding is [29,
    30]. To avoid the error, the padding values should be less than 3 and 2 respectively.
    Therefore, the constraints can be expressed as:'
  target: Padding value causes wrapping around more than once.
  txt: padding[0] < input.shape[2] and padding[1] < input.shape[3]
- cot: 'The error occurs because the number of channels in the input tensor doesn''t
    match the expected number of channels based on the convolution parameters. Let''s
    see what the args were. It appears the given number of input channels is 8 which
    is not equal to the expected 500 channels. To prevent this error in the future
    and generate constraints that do not trigger it, we need to ensure that the "in_channels"
    value is equal to the second dimension of the input tensor.


    The constraint for the ''in_channels'' parameter can be expressed as:'
  target: Given groups=1, weight of size [500, 500, 1, 1], expected input[4, 8, 4,
    13] to have 500 channels, but got 8 channels instead
  txt: in_channels == input.shape[1]
- cot: 'Error is triggered because of negative padding values. Let''s see what the
    args were. The padding has negative value. It does not inform us which padding
    to correct, so <symbol> or all(<symbol>) should be corrected, which is padding
    or all(padding). Therefore, Left : padding or all(padding). It implies that negative
    values are problem., so Op : >=, and Right : 0.'
  target: negative padding is not supported
  txt: all(padding[i] >= 0 for i in range(len(padding)))
- cot: 'The error is generated because the ''in_channels'' value is not divisible
    by the ''groups'' value. From the values, ''in_channels'' is 500 and ''groups''
    is 7. To prevent this error, ''in_channels'' must be divisible by ''groups''.
    Therefore, Left : in_channels, Op : %, Right : groups. The remainder should be
    0, so Op : ==, Right : 0.'
  target: in_channels must be divisible by groups
  txt: in_channels % groups == 0 and out_channels % groups == 0
- cot: 'The error is due to trying to create a tensor with a negative dimension. The
    ''in_channels'' argument is -500, which is invalid because dimensions of a tensor
    must be non-negative integers. The constraint that needs to be enforced here is
    that ''in_channels'' must be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, the logical
    constraint would look like this:'
  target: 'Trying to create tensor with negative dimension -500: [5, -500]'
  txt: ((out_channels >= 0)) and ((in_channels >= 0))
- cot: 'The error is due to the incorrect value of ''stride''. The expected value
    for ''stride'' is a single integer or a list containing only one integer to match
    the convolution dimensions. However, in the given values, stride is provided as
    1. This means that stride is considered as [1, 1] which is not matching the expected
    condition.


    To prevent this error, we need to ensure that stride has only one value. We can
    express this constraint as:'
  target: expected padding to be a single integer value or a list of 1 values to match
    the convolution dimensions, but got padding=[9, 8, 1, 1, 1]
  txt: len(stride) == 1
- cot: 'The error is due to unsupported padding dimensions or padding mode. Let''s
    see what the args were. The padding mode is ''circular'' which might not be supported.
    Therefore, Left : padding_mode, op : !=, right : ''circular''. From the error
    message, we can assume the padding size should be 2D, 3D, 4D or 5D. Therefore,
    Left : len(padding), op : in, right : [2, 3, 4, 5].'
  target: Only 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D padding with non-constant padding are supported for
    now

- cot: 'The error message indicates that the input type and bias type should be the
    same, but in the given values, the input type is "c10::complex<double>" and the
    bias type is "float". What the args were? If we look at the provided arguments,
    we can see that ''input'' is a tensor of type TensorDType.complex128 and ''bias''
    is a float. Therefore, either the ''input'' should be changed to float or ''bias''
    should be changed to complex. Therefore, Left : type(input) or type(bias). Op
    : ==, Right : float or complex.'
  target: Input type (c10::complex<double>) and bias type (float) should be the same
  txt: (len(kernel_size) > 0) or (type(input)==float)
- cot: 'The error is due to the ''groups'' parameter which must be a positive integer.
    From the given values, groups value is 0. Therefore, Left : groups, Op : >, Right
    : 0. Additionally, it must be an integer, so Op: == , and Right : int(groups).'
  target: groups must be a positive integer
  txt: groups > 0
- cot: 'The error is due to the input tensor having more dimensions than expected.
    The conv2d function expects either a 3D or 4D tensor, where the first dimension
    is typically the batch size. However, the provided input tensor was of 5 dimensions.
    To prevent this error from happening again, we need to ensure that the input tensor
    has either 3 or 4 dimensions.


    We can express this constraint as follows:'
