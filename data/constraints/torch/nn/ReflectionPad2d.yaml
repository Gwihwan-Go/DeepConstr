- cot: 'The error is due to the padding being applied to a tensor of unsupported dimensions.
    The tensor input is 2D, which is supported, but the padding value is too large.
    Therefore, there are two constraints to consider here. One is the shape of the
    input tensor, and the other is the padding value. For the input tensor, Left:
    input.rank, Op: in, Right: [2, 3, 4, 5]. For the padding, Left: padding, Op: <=,

- cot: 'The error is due to the padding length being larger than twice the dimension
    of the input. In this case, the padding length is 4 and the input dimension is
    1. To avoid this error, we need to ensure that the padding length is always less
    than or equal to twice the dimension of the input. If we denote the dimension
    of the input as n, the padding length as p, then the constraint can be expressed
    as:'
  target: Padding length should be less than or equal to two times the input dimension
    but got padding length 4 and input of dimension 1

    and input [2, 1, 8]. This implies that padding on dimension 1 should be less than
    input dimension 1. Therefore, Left : padding[1]. Op : <. Right : input.shape[1]'
  target: 'Argument #6: Padding size should be less than the corresponding input dimension,
