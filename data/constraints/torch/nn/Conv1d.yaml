- cot: 'The error is caused by the mismatch between the ''groups'' parameter and the
    dimension 0 of the weight tensor. The ''groups'' parameter is used to control
    the connections between inputs and outputs, and it divides the input channels
    into groups. Each group is convolved with a set of filters (weights). Therefore,
    the size of dimension 0 of the weight tensor should be at least the same as the
    ''groups'' parameter. In this case, ''groups'' is 1, but the size of dimension
    0 of the weight tensor is 0, causing the error.


    To prevent this error, we need to ensure that the size of dimension 0 of the weight
    tensor is always greater than or equal to the ''groups'' parameter. This can be
    expressed as:'
  target: Given groups=1, expected weight to be at least 1 at dimension 0, but got
    weight of size [0, 0, 9] instead
  txt: out_channels > 0
- cot: 'The error message states that the ''out_channels'' must be divisible by ''groups''.
    Given that ''out_channels'' is 1 and ''groups'' is 6 from the given values, it
    is clear that ''out_channels'' is not divisible by ''groups''. Therefore, Left
    : out_channels should be divisible by groups, so op : ''%'', and Right : 0.'
  target: out_channels must be divisible by groups
  txt: out_channels % groups == 0
- cot: 'Error is triggered because the kernel size is larger than the actual input
    size. Looking at the provided values, kernel_size = 6 and input.shape = [8, 8,
    4]. The kernel size can''t be greater than the actual input size, so kernel_size
    should be less than or equal to the size of the input. Therefore, we need to revise
    the constraints as follows:'
  target: 'Calculated padded input size per channel: (2). Kernel size: (16). Kernel
    size can''t be greater than actual input size'
  txt: kernel_size <= min(input.shape)
- cot: 'The error is due to trying to create a tensor with negative dimension -1.
    Let''s see what the args were. It seems dilation, kernel_size and stride have
    negative values. They should be non-negative. Also, the in_channels should match
    with the second dimension of the input tensor. Therefore, the constraints could
    be as follows:'
  target: 'Trying to create tensor with negative dimension -1: [500, 3, -1]'
  txt: (bias == True) or (groups == 2)
- cot: 'Error is triggered because of wrong padding size. Padding size should be less
    than the dimension size of the input tensor. Here, padding is 2, but the size
    at dimension 2 of the input tensor is 1 which is less than the padding. So, the
    constraint should be: padding size should be less than the corresponding input
    dimension size.'
  target: 'Argument #4: Padding size should be less than the corresponding input dimension,
    but got: padding (2, 2) at dimension 2 of input [8, 6, 1]'

- cot: 'The error is triggered because the ''groups'' value is not a positive integer.
    In the given values, ''groups'' is set to 0 which is not a positive integer. Therefore,
    the Left : ''groups'' should be corrected to a positive integer. Ops : ''>'',

    Let''s see what the args were. From the given values, we can see that the ''padding''
    parameter is an empty list, and the ''input'' tensor dimension is a length-3 list.
    Therefore, the padding should be a list with either a single value or a list of
    1 value that corresponds to the input tensor''s dimension.
