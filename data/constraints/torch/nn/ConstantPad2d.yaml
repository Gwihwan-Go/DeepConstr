rules:
- cot: 'The error is happening due to the ''padding'' value exceeding the maximum
    allowed limit, which is two times the input dimension. In this case, the input
    tensor has a dimension of 1, and the ''padding'' value is 5, which is more than
    two times the input dimension. The ''value'' argument does not seem to be causing
    any error in this case.


    To prevent this error from happening, we need to ensure that the ''padding'' value
    is always less than or equal to two times the input dimension. If we denote the
    dimension of the input tensor as d, the constraint for the ''padding'' parameter
    can be expressed as:'
  target: Padding length should be less than or equal to two times the input dimension
    but got padding length 4 and input of dimension 1
  txt: (len(padding) <= 2*len(input.shape)) or (padding <= 2*len(input.shape))
- cot: 'Error is triggered because padding length is not divisible by 2. Let''s see
    what the args were. The padding length was 1, which is not divisible by 2. Therefore,
    the Left : len(padding) Op : ''%'', Right : 2 should be corrected to 0.'
  target: Padding length must be divisible by 2
  txt: len(padding) % 2 == 0
- cot: 'Error is triggered because of negative length in the narrow() function. Let''s
    see what the args were. It seems like ''padding'' is negative, this might be causing
    the issue. The narrow() function expects non-negative length. Therefore, Left
    : padding. It implies that negative values are problem, so Op : >=, and Right
    : 0.'
  target: 'narrow(): length must be non-negative.'
  txt: padding >= 0
