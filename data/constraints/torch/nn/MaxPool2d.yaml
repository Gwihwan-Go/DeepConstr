- cot: 'Error is triggered because padding size is not at most half of kernel size.
    From the given arguments, it can be seen that the kernel_size is 5 and padding
    is 4. The constraint here is that padding should be at most half of kernel size.
    Therefore, we can revise the constraints as follows:'
  target: pad should be at most half of kernel size, but got pad=4 and kernel_size=5
  txt: padding <= kernel_size / 2
- cot: 'The error indicates that the ''dilation'' argument must be either a single
    integer or a tuple of two integers. In the provided arguments, ''dilation'' is
    an empty list. So, it needs to be corrected. Therefore, Left: len(dilation), Op:
    ''=='', Right: 1 or 2, and the type of dilation should be int or tuple.'
  target: 'max_pool2d: padding must either be a single int, or a tuple of two ints'
  txt: (len(padding)==2) or (len(dilation) in [1, 2])
- cot: 'The error is triggered because output size is too small. Let''s see the args
    were. The input size is (6x8x6) and the calculated output size is (6x1x-48). This
    issue might be related to the kernel size, stride, padding and dilation. Therefore,
    the constraints are as follows:


    First, the kernel size should be less than or equal to the size of the input in
    each dimension.'
  target: 'Given input size: (6x8x6). Calculated output size: (6x1x-48). Output size
    is too small'
  txt: (padding >= 0) and (kernel_size <= min(input.shape))
- cot: 'Error is triggered because a 3D or 4D tensor is expected for input, but a
    1D tensor is provided. Let''s see what the args were. It seems that the input
    tensor has 1 dimension, and is the problem. The number of dimensions of the input
    tensor should be corrected. Therefore, Left : input.ndims(). It says that expected
    3D or 4D, so Op : ==, and Right : 3 or 4. Also, the tensor cannot be empty, so
    Op : !=, and Right : 0.'
  target: non-empty 3D or 4D (batch mode) tensor expected for input
  txt: input.ndims() == 4
- cot: 'The error is due to the invalid ''stride'' values. Let''s see what the args
    were. It seems that ''stride'' is the stride value and it''s currently [19,-1],
    where the stride ''dH'' is 19 and ''dW'' is -1. The stride should be greater than
    zero for both ''dH'' and ''dW''. Therefore, Left : stride which is the stride
    value should be corrected. It says that it should be greater than 0 for both ''dH''
    and ''dW'', so Op : >, and Right : 0.'
  target: 'stride should be greater than zero, but got dH: 19 dW: -1'

- cot: "The error occurs because the dilation values are set to zero, which is not\
    \ an acceptable value. Dilation should always be greater than zero for proper\
    \ functioning. Let's see what the args were. The given 'dilation' value is 0 which\
    \ is not valid. To prevent this error, we need to ensure that the 'dilation' value\
    \ is always greater than 0. \n\nThe constraint for the 'dilation' parameter can\
    \ be expressed as:"
  target: 'dilation should be greater than zero, but got dilationH: 0 dilationW: 0'
