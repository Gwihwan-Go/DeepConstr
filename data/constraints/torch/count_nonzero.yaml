- cot: "The error is due to the invalid dimension - the dimension provided is 4, but\
    \ the valid range for the dimension is between -4 and 3 (both inclusive) for the\
    \ given tensor. So, the dimension 'dim' should be less than the length of the\
    \ input tensor shape and greater than or equal to the negative of the length of\
    \ the input tensor shape. \n\nTherefore, we can express the constraint for 'dim'\
