rules:
- cot: 'The error is due to the ''dim'' value being out of the expected range. The
    expected range for ''dim'' is [-1, 0], but the provided value is -2. To prevent
    this error, the ''dim'' value needs to be checked to ensure it falls within the
    expected range. Therefore, Left : dim, Op : >=, Right : -1 and Left : dim, Op
    : <=, Right : 0.'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-1, 0], but got -2)
  txt: (dim <= 0) and (dim >= -1)
- cot: 'The error occurs because the ''index'' value is out of range for the ''input''
    tensor at dimension 0. The ''index'' value from args is 1, but the size of the
    tensor at dimension 0 is 1. Therefore, ''index'' should be less than the size
    of the tensor at the specified ''dim''. Thus the constraints should be: ''index''
    < input.shape[''dim''], Op : <, and Right : input.shape[''dim''].'
  target: 'select(): index 1 out of range for tensor of size [1, 6, 8, 6, 6, 1, 3,
    4] at dimension 0'
  txt: index < input.shape[dim]
- cot: The error says that the select() function cannot be applied to a 0-dim tensor.
    This means that the tensor has no dimensions to select from. The 'dim' and 'index'
    parameters are used to select a slice from the 'input' tensor along a specific
    dimension. The 'dim' parameter specifies the dimension to select from and the
    'index' parameter specifies the index of the slice to select. Since the 'input'
    tensor is 0-dim, it has no dimensions to select from. Therefore, the 'input' tensor
    should have at least one dimension. So, len(input.shape) should be > 0. Also,
    the 'dim' parameter should be a valid dimension of the 'input' tensor, so dim
    should be < len(input.shape). And, the 'index' parameter should be a valid index
    of the selected dimension, so index should be < input.shape[dim].
  target: select() cannot be applied to a 0-dim tensor.
  txt: len(input.shape) > 0
