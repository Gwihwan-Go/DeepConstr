    outputs. Therefore the dimensionality and datatype of the inputs and outputs must

    In this case, the ''out'' tensor shape does not match with the operation results.
    In this operation, the result shape is input.shape. Therefore, the ''out'' tensor
    shape should be same as ''input'' tensor shape. So left : out.shape, out.rank
