- cot: 'The error occurs because the output tensor''s data type is not as expected.
    The function expects the output tensor to have a float data type. However, in
    the given values, the data type of the output tensor is ''int''. Therefore, the
    data type of the output tensor, which is type(out), should be corrected. It should
    be equal to ''float'', so Op : ==, and Right : ''float''.'
  target: Expected out tensor to have dtype float, but got int instead
  txt: (input.shape == out.shape) and (type(out) == 'float')
- cot: 'The error indicates that the ''input'' tensor has 1 dimension, but it needs
    at least 2 dimensions to avoid the renorm error. Let''s generate constraints based
    on the values. It seems ''input'' is the problem tensor as it''s dimension is
    1. Therefore, Left : ''input''.ndims(). As the expected minimum dimensions are
    2, so Op : >=, and Right : 2. This implies that the dimension of ''input'' cannot
    be 1, so Op : !=, and Right : 1.'
  target: 'renorm: input needs at least 2 dimensions, got 1 dimensions'
  txt: '''input''.ndims() >= 2'
- cot: "The error occurs because the dimension provided is out of the valid range.\
    \ The valid range of dimensions for the input tensor with shape [8,8] is [-2,\
    \ 1] (in Python, indexing is 0-based and negative indices count from the end).\
    \ However, the given dimension is 7 which is out of this range. \n\nTo prevent\
    \ this error in the future and generate constraints that do not trigger it, we\
    \ need to ensure that the \"dim\" value is always within the valid range for the\
    \ given tensor. For a tensor of shape (8, 8), this range is [-2, 1]. If we denote\
    \ the shape of the tensor as n, the valid range for the dimension would be [-n,\
    \ n-1].\n\nThe constraint for the 'dim' parameter can be expressed as:"
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-2, 1], but got 7)
  txt: dim >= -len(input.shape) and dim < len(input.shape)
- cot: The error is triggered because 'p' is a negative value, and the renorm operation
    does not support non-positive norms. Therefore, the constraint should be that
    'p' must be greater than zero.
  target: 'renorm: non-positive-norm not supported'
  txt: p > 0
- cot: 'From the error message, it''s clear that the ''maxnorm'' value is expected
    to be >= 0, but a negative value is being provided, causing the error. The related
    value key is ''maxnorm''. So, the Left : maxnorm. The operator here would be >=,
    since it should be greater than or equal to 0. And the Right : 0. It also implies
    that ''maxnorm'' should not be negative. So, the second constraint can be maxnorm
    should not be less than 0. Therefore, Op : <, Right : 0.'
  target: 'renorm: expected maxnorm to be >= 0 but got -1.52724'
  txt: maxnorm >= 0
