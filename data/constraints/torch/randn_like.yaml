- cot: 'The error is due to the ''input'' Tensor having an incompatible type for the
    "normal_kernel_cpu" function. The ''input'' tensor is of type ''Long'' (int64),
    which is not supported by the "normal_kernel_cpu" function. Therefore, the constraint
    that needs to be established is that the ''input'' tensor should be of a data
    type compatible with the "normal_kernel_cpu" function. The ''requires_grad'' attribute
    being ''False'' is not related to this error. The constraint can be written as:'
  target: '"normal_kernel_cpu" not implemented for ''Long'''
  txt: input.dtype != torch.int64
- cot: 'The error is due to an operation "normal_kernel_cpu" that is not implemented
    for ''Int''. From the args, the input tensor is of type ''int32'' and ''requires_grad''
    is set to True. Therefore, the data type of the input tensor should be changed
    from ''int32'' to a type that is compatible with the "normal_kernel_cpu" operation.
    The ''requires_grad'' attribute could also be affecting the operation, so it could
    be set to False. Therefore, for the ''input'' Left : input.dtype, should not be
    ''int32'', so Op : !=, and Right : ''int32''. And for ''requires_grad'', Left
    : requires_grad, it should be False, so Op : ==, and Right : False.'
  target: '"normal_kernel_cpu" not implemented for ''Int'''
  txt: input.dtype != 'int32'
- cot: The error is due to the function "normal_kernel_cpu" not being implemented
    for the 'Short' data type. To avoid the error, the data type of the input should
    not be 'Short'. Therefore, the data type of the input must be any data type except
    'Short'.
