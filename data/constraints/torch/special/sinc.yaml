    This might be because the dimensions of ''out'' tensor are different from the
    dimensions of the ''input'' tensor. The dimensions of the input tensor are [8,
    4, 2] and the dimensions of the out tensor are [1, 6]. Therefore, the possible
    constraint can be to ensure that the dimensions match. Therefore, Left: len(input),
    Op: ''=='', and Right: len(out).'
