- cot: 'The error is caused because the result type Float cannot be cast to the desired
    output type Long. Looking at the arguments, the input tensor has a dtype of bool
    and the output tensor has a dtype of int64. The dtype of the input tensor and
    output tensor should match to avoid this error. Therefore, Left : dtype of ''input'',
    Op : ==, Right : dtype of ''out''.'
  target: result type Float can't be cast to the desired output type Long
  txt: (type(out) == float) and (type(input)==type(out))
- cot: 'The error occurs because the ''out'' tensor is not of the same shape as the
    ''input'' tensor. The ''out'' tensor has a shape of [1, 3], while the ''input''
    tensor has a shape of [9, 8]. Therefore, the operation to resize the ''out'' tensor
    to match the ''input'' tensor''s shape is not possible.


    The constraints that can be generated to prevent this error from occurring are
    as follows:


    1. Ensure that the ''out'' tensor has the same shape as the ''input'' tensor before
    performing operations. In this context, the ''out'' tensor should have the shape
    [9, 8] to match the ''input'' tensor.


    2. Check if the ''out'' tensor is resizable before attempting to resize it. If
    it isn''t, create a new tensor with the correct shape instead.


    So, the logical relationship constraints are as follows:'
  target: Trying to resize storage that is not resizable
  txt: (out.rank >= input.rank and all((out.shape[i] == input.shape[i] or out.shape[i]
    == 1) for i in range(-1, -input.rank-1, -1))) and (all(out.shape[i]==input.shape[i]
    for i in range(out.rank)))
