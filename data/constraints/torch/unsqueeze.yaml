rules:
- cot: "Based on the provided values, the 'input' is a tensor with a shape of [2].\
    \ This means that valid dimensions are in the range of [-2, 1]. However, 'dim'\
    \ is currently set to 7, which is outside of the valid range.\n\nTo prevent this\
    \ error and generate constraints that do not trigger it, we need to ensure that\
    \ the 'dim' value is always within the valid range for the given tensor. \n\n\
    The constraint for the 'dim' parameter can be expressed as:"
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-2, 1], but got 7)
  txt: dim >= -len(input.shape) and dim < len(input.shape)
