- cot: 'The error arises because the ''from'' value is larger than the ''to'' value
    in the ''random_'' function. Let''s see what the args were. The ''from'' value
    is represented by ''low'' and is currently 9, while the ''to'' value is represented
    by ''high'' and is presently 8. Therefore, to avoid this error in the future,
    we need to ensure that the ''from'' value is always less than the ''to'' value.


    The constraint for ''low'' and ''high'' parameters can be expressed as:'
  target: random_ expects 'from' to be less than 'to', but got from=9 >= to=8
  txt: low < high
