    to be meaningful. The ''density'' value is correct as it is a boolean. The ''range''
    values should not be the same for a valid range. The ''weight'' tensor''s data

    as ''Half''. However, the ''histogram_cpu'' function does not support ''Half''
    type tensors. Therefore, Left : input.dtype and weight.dtype should be corrected

    were. It appears the range is an empty list which is causing the issue. To prevent
    this error in the future and generate constraints that do not trigger it, we need
    to ensure that the "range" value always contains 2 elements when generating a

    of [1, 1, 8, 8, 7]. Therefore, the weight tensor should have the same shape as

    trying to apply a histogram with given ''bins'' and ''range''. But ''range'' is
    invalid because minimum value is greater than maximum value, which is not acceptable.
    Thus, for ''range'', Left : range[0], it should not exceed max, so Op : <=, and
    Right : range[1]. Also, the ''input'' Tensor should not have values outside this
    range. So, all elements in ''input'' tensor should be within ''range'', Op : >=

    the args were? The function torch.histogram() expects a ''bins'' value that is
