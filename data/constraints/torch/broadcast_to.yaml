- cot: The error occurs because the expanded size of the tensor (17) does not match
    the existing size (4) at non-singleton dimension 7. The target sizes are [4, 11,
    12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] while the tensor size is [4], which are not compatible.
    Therefore, the constraint should be that the size of the input tensor should be
    the same as the target size at non-singleton dimensions.
  target: 'The expanded size of the tensor (14) must match the existing size (8) at
    non-singleton dimension 2.  Target sizes: [12, 13, 14].  Tensor sizes: [10, 9,
    8]'
