- cot: 'The error is due to mismatched channel sizes. The number of channels in the
    input tensor (8) is not equal to the number of channels specified in the weight
    tensor (6). The group parameter is 1, which means Convolution is not grouped.
    Given groups = 1, the number of channels in the input tensor should be equal to
    the second dimension of the weight tensor. Therefore, Left : input.shape[1] (8),
    Op : ==, Right : weight.shape[1] (6)'
  target: Given groups=1, weight of size [1, 6, 9, 7], expected input[2, 8, 2, 6]
    to have 6 channels, but got 8 channels instead
  txt: input.shape[1] == weight.shape[1]
- cot: 'The error occurs because the ''groups'' value is 0. Groups value should be
    positive and not zero in tensor operations. So, the Left : ''groups'', Op : should
    be ''>'', Right : 0.'

    message suggests that the stride should be a single integer or a list of exactly
    5 values to match the convolution dimensions. So, the length of the stride list,
    which is len(stride), should be corrected. Therefore, Left : len(stride). It says
    that stride length should be 5, so Op : ==, and Right : 5. Also, it could be a
    single integer, so Op : ==, and Right : 1.'
  target: expected stride to be a single integer value or a list of 5 values to match

- cot: 'The error is due to the wrong dimension of the input tensor. In the given
    values, input tensor is 2D with size [8, 2] which is not suitable for the conv2d
    function as it requires the input tensor to be 3D (unbatched) or 4D (batched).
