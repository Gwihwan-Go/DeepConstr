  txt: (size <= input.shape[dimension]) and (input.shape[dimension] <= size)
- cot: 'The error is due to the ''dimension'' value being out of the valid range.
    For ''dimension'', the value provided is -2, which is not in the allowed range
    of [-1, 0]. Therefore, type(dimension) should be corrected to be within the range
    [-1, 0], which is [-1, 0]. Op : in, and Right : [-1, 0].'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-1, 0], but got -2)
