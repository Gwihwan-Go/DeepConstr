- cot: 'Error is triggered because of 0-dimensional tensor. It expects to have at
    least 2 dimensions. Let''s see what the args were. It seems ''input'' has 0 dimensions,
    and is the problem. So the number of dimensions of ''input'' should be corrected,
    which is input.ndims(). Therefore, Left : input.ndims(). It says that expected
    at least 2, so Op : >=, and Right : 2. It also implies that the dimension cannot
    be 0, so Op : !=, and Right : 0.'
  target: torch.vsplit requires a tensor with at least 2 dimension, but got a tensor
    with 0 dimensions!
  txt: input.ndims() >= 2
