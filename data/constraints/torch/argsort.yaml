rules:
- cot: 'The error is due to the ''dim'' attribute having a value of 7, which is outside
    the expected range of [-1, 0]. This means that ''dim'' is referring to a dimension
    that does not exist in the ''input'' tensor. The ''input'' tensor has no dimensions,
    as indicated by the empty list []. So, the value of ''dim'' should be corrected
    to be either -1 or 0. The Left : dim. Therefore, Op : ==, and Right : -1 or 0.'
  target: Dimension out of range (expected to be in range of [-1, 0], but got 7)
  txt: ('dim' <= input.rank - 1) or (dim == 0)
