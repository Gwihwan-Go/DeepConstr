- cot: 'The error is due to the shapes of ''t'', ''clip_value_min'', and ''clip_value_max''
    not being broadcastable. The arguments were: ''t'' was a tensor of float32 with
    shape [1, 4, 3], ''clip_value_min'' was a tensor of float32 with shape [5, 1,
    3], and ''clip_value_max'' was a tensor of float32 with shape [10]. For the tensors
    to be broadcastable, for each dimension starting from the last, the size of the
    dimension in each tensor should be equal or one of them should be 1. Also, the
    number of dimensions of ''clip_value_max'' should be either equal to the number
    of dimensions of ''t'' and ''clip_value_min'' or should be 1. Therefore, we can
    revise the constraints as follows:'
  target: 'rror: required broadcastable shapes [Op:Minimum] name:'
  txt: (all(t.shape[i] == clip_value_min.shape[i] or t.shape[i] == 1 or clip_value_min.shape[i]
    == 1 for i in range(-1, -min(len(t.shape), len(clip_value_min.shape))-1, -1)))
    and (all(t.shape[i] == clip_value_max.shape[i] or t.shape[i] == 1 or clip_value_max.shape[i]
    == 1 for i in range(-1, -min(len(t.shape), len(clip_value_max.shape))-1, -1)))
- cot: 'The error is due to the incompatible shapes of ''t'' and ''clip_value_max''.
    Broadcasting is causing an issue because the shapes do not align in the last dimension.
    The shapes (1,) and (5,) are not broadcastable because their last dimensions are
    not equal and none of them is 1. So, the constraint should be either the size
    of ''t'' and ''clip_value_max'' be the same or one of them should be 1. Here,
    ''t'' has a shape of (1,) which is compatible with any other shapes for broadcasting.
    The problem here arises from ''clip_value_max'' having a shape of (5,), which
    is not compatible with ''t'' nor ''clip_value_min''. Therefore, the logical relationship
    constraints would be:'
  target: 'rror: Shapes (7,) and (1, 10, 10, 4, 6, 7) are incompatible'
  txt: (clip_value_max.shape[0] == 1) and (clip_value_max.shape[-1] == 1)
- cot: 'The error arises because the operation ''Minimum'' is trying to compare an
    int32 tensor with a float tensor, which is not allowed. The data types of all
    three tensors need to be the same. Here, tensor ''t'' is of int32 type, but ''clip_value_min''
    and ''clip_value_max'' are of float32 type. Therefore, we need to ensure that
    all tensors are of the same data type. In Python, we can use the dtype property
    of a tensor to get its data type:'
  target: 'rror: cannot compute Minimum as input #1(zero-based) was expected to be
    a int32 tensor but is a float tensor [Op:Minimum] name:'
  txt: (clip_value_min.shape == t.shape) or (t.dtype == clip_value_max.dtype)
- cot: 'The error arises due to the tensor ''t'' having a rank greater than 5 as it
    has 8 dimensions. The clip_value_min and clip_value_max tensors also exceed this
    limit as they have 10 dimensions each. Therefore, to avoid the error, the rank
    of all tensors should be less than or equal to 5. To correct this, Left : t.dim(),
    clip_value_min.dim(), and clip_value_max.dim() should be corrected. Ops : ''<='',
    Right : 5.'
  target: 'rror: Input for dynamic binary or n-ary op lowering was of a rank greater
    than 5 [Op:Minimum] name:'
  txt: t.dim() <= 5
