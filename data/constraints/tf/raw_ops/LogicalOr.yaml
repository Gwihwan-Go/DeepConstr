- cot: 'The error arises because the function is trying to perform a logical operation
    on float tensors. However, logical operations require boolean tensors. Looking
    at the args, both the ''x'' and ''y'' tensors are of type float32. Therefore,
    the data types of tensors ''x'' and ''y'' should be corrected. The expected type
    is bool, so the operation would be Op : ==, and Right : bool.'

    be a bool tensor but is a float tensor [Op:LogicalOr] name:'
  txt: (type(x)==bool) and (type(y)==bool)
- cot: 'The error is caused because the rank of the input tensors for the operation
    is greater than 5. The rank of a tensor is the number of dimensions in it. In
    this case, the tensor ''x'' has a rank of 5 and the tensor ''y'' has a rank of
    10. Therefore, the Left : rank of both tensors should be corrected. It says that
    the rank of both tensors should be less than or equal to 5, so Op : <=, and Right
    : 5.'
  target: 'rror: Input for dynamic binary or n-ary op lowering was of a rank greater

- cot: 'The error is due to the shapes of ''x'' and ''y'' not being broadcastable.
    For ''LogicalOr'' operation, it requires that the trailing dimensions of the tensors
    are either 1 or the same. The current shapes of ''x'' and ''y'' are [8] and [3]
    respectively. Therefore, the constraint should be that the shape of ''x'' should
    be equal to the shape of ''y'' or one of them should be 1. We start from the last
    dimension because broadcasting aligns dimensions from the end. Therefore, we can
    revise the constraints as follows:'
