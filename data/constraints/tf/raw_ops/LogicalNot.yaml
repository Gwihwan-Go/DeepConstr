    on a float tensor. However, this operation requires a bool tensor. Let''s see
    what the args were. It seems ''x'' tensor is of float32 type, which is the issue.
    Therefore, Left : type(x), which is the type of tensor x, should be corrected.
    It says that should be equal to the datatype of bool tensor, so Op : ==, and Right
    : bool.'
