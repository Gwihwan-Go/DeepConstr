rules:
- cot: The error is due to an invalid attribute 'complex32' in Tensorflow. Looking
    at the args, 'x' and 'y' are tensors with dtype 'uint8'. There are no complex32
    types in Tensorflow. The types should be one of the valid Tensorflow dtypes. Therefore,
    type(x) and type(y) should be in valid Tensorflow dtypes. Also, the shape of 'y'
    has a zero dimension, which may cause issues. All dimensions of 'x' and 'y' should
    be non-zero.
  target: 'rror: module ''tensorflow'' has no attribute ''complex32'''
  txt: all(y[i]!=0 for i in range(len(y.shape)))
- cot: 'The error arises because the function is trying to perform an add operation
    on a complex128 tensor and a float tensor. However, both tensors must have the
    same data type. Let''s see what the args were. The ''x'' tensor is complex64,
    but the ''y'' tensor is of type float32. Thus, the type of tensor ''y'' should
    be corrected. Therefore, Left : type(y), which is the type of tensor y, should
    be corrected. It says that it should be equal to the datatype of tensor x, so
    Op : ==, and Right : type(x).'
  target: 'rror: cannot compute Add as input #1(zero-based) was expected to be a complex128
    tensor but is a float tensor [Op:Add] name:'
  txt: type(y)==type(x)
- cot: 'The error is due to the rank of the input tensor being greater than the limit
    for dynamic binary or n-ary op lowering, which is 5. Looking at the args, the
    ''x'' tensor has a rank of 4, which is fine, but the ''y'' tensor has a rank of
    9, which is too high. Therefore, the Left : y.rank, which is the rank of tensor
    y, should be corrected. It says that should be less than or equal to 5, so Op
    : <=, and Right : 5.'
  target: 'rror: Input for dynamic binary or n-ary op lowering was of a rank greater
    than 5 [Op:Add] name:'
  txt: (rank(x) <= 5) and (y.rank <= 5)
- cot: 'The error is due to the shapes of ''''x'''' and ''''y'''' not being broadcastable.
    Broadcasting in tensor operations requires that the trailing dimensions of the
    tensors are either 1 or the same. After observing the shapes of ''''x'''' and
    ''''y'''', we can see that ''x'' has a shape of [9] and ''y'' has a shape of [1,
    3, 7, 8, 8]. The last dimension of ''x'' is 9 which does not match the last dimension
    of ''y'' which is 8 and neither of them is 1. Therefore, the constraint should
    be that for each dimension starting from the last, the size of the dimension in
    ''''x'''' should be equal to the size of the dimension in ''''y'''' or one of
    them should be 1. We start from the last dimension because broadcasting aligns
    dimensions from the end. We can revise the constraints as follows:'
  target: 'rror: required broadcastable shapes [Op:Add] name:'
  txt: all(x.shape[i] == y.shape[i] or x.shape[i] == 1 or y.shape[i] == 1 for i in
    range(-1, -min(len(x.shape), len(y.shape))-1, -1))
