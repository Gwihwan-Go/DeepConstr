    rank 10, which is greater than 5. Therefore, the Left : x.rank and y.rank, which
    are the ranks of tensors x and y, should be corrected. They should be less than
    or equal to 5, so Op : ''<='', and Right : 5.'

- cot: 'The error is occurring because the LogicalAnd operation expects boolean tensors,
    but it is receiving float tensors. It seems that the ''x'' and ''y'' tensors are
    of type float32 and float64 respectively. This means that the type of both tensors
    should be boolean to prevent the error. Therefore, we can generate the following
    constraints:'

    \ the trailing dimensions of the tensors are either 1 or the same. We can see\
    \ from the given values that 'x' has shape [9, 8, 6, 8] and 'y' has shape [7,\
    \ 8, 2]. These shapes are not compatible for broadcasting because their trailing\
    \ dimensions are not the same and none of them is 1. \n\nThe constraint should\
    \ be that for each dimension starting from the last, the size of the dimension\
    \ in 'y' should be equal to the size of the dimension in 'x' or one of them should\
    \ be 1. We start from the last dimension because broadcasting aligns dimensions\
    \ from the end. Therefore, we can revise the constraints as follows:"
