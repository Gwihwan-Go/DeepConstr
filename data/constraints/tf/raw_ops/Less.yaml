- cot: 'The error is triggered because Tensorflow does not have an attribute ''complex32''.
    It seems like the user is trying to use a non-existent data type ''TensorDType.uint32''
    for the tensors ''x'' and ''y''. Therefore, the data type of the tensor should
    be changed to one of the valid data types that Tensorflow supports. Here are the
    constraints:'
  target: 'rror: module ''tensorflow'' has no attribute ''complex32'''
  txt: x.dtype in tensorflow.dtypes
- cot: 'Error is triggered because the "Less" operation expects both inputs to be
    of the same type, specifically a float tensor, but one of them is an int16 tensor.
    From the values provided, variable x is a float tensor and y is an int16 tensor.
    The type mismatch is causing the error. Therefore, the constraint we need to impose
    is that the tensor type of y must be the same as the tensor type of x. Hence,
    the constraint is:'
  target: 'rror: cannot compute Less as input #1(zero-based) was expected to be a
    float tensor but is a int16 tensor [Op:Less] name:'
  txt: y.dtype == x.dtype
- cot: 'The error message suggests that the input for a dynamic binary or n-ary operation
    has a rank greater than 5, which is not allowed. In this case, the inputs are
    ''x'' and ''y'' tensors. The ''x'' tensor has a rank of 7 and the ''y'' tensor
    has a rank of 5. To prevent this error from occurring, we can add a constraint
    that the rank of the ''x'' and ''y'' tensors must be less than or equal to 5.
    Therefore, Left : x.rank, y.rank, Ops : ''<='', Right : 5.'
  target: 'rror: Input for dynamic binary or n-ary op lowering was of a rank greater
    than 5 [Op:Less] name:'
  txt: x.rank() <= 5
- cot: 'The error is due to the shapes of ''x'' and ''y'' not being broadcastable.
    The shapes of ''x'' and ''y'' are [9, 6, 6] and [6, 9, 6, 6, 8] respectively.
    Broadcasting in tensor operations requires that the trailing dimensions of the
    tensors are either 1 or the same. So, the constraint should be that for each dimension
    starting from the last, the size of the dimension in ''x'' should be equal to
    the size of the dimension in ''y'' or one of them should be 1. We start from the
    last dimension because broadcasting aligns dimensions from the end. Therefore,
    we can revise the constraints as follows:'
  target: 'rror: required broadcastable shapes [Op:Less] name:'
  txt: all(x.shape[i] == y.shape[i] or x.shape[i] == 1 or y.shape[i] == 1 for i in
    range(-1, -min(len(x.shape), len(y.shape))-1, -1))
- cot: 'The error arises because the function is trying to perform an operation on
    boolean tensors ''x'' and ''y''. However, the allowed data types for this operation
    are float, double, int32, uint8, int16, int8, int64, bfloat16, uint16, half, uint32,
    uint64. Therefore, the data types of both ''x'' and ''y'' should be corrected.
    It says that the type of tensors ''x'' and ''y'' should be equal to the allowed
    data types. So, Op : in, and Right : [float, double, int32, uint8, int16, int8,
