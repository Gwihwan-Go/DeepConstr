- cot: 'The error is caused due to a power operation being performed on an integer
    with a negative exponent. In the given case, the tensor ''x'' and ''y'' are both
    of integer types. The power operation in question seems to be on the elements
    of ''x'' and ''y''. However, negative powers of integers are not allowed. Therefore,
    there are two constraints to be satisfied here. First, the elements in ''y'' should
    not be negative to avoid negative exponentiation. Second, ''x'' should not be
    an integer to allow for negative exponentiation. Therefore:


    1) All the elements in ''y'' must be non-negative. It means every element ''i''
    of ''y'' should satisfy the condition i >= 0. This can be represented as'

- cot: 'The error suggests that the operation is expecting a complex64 tensor but
    is receiving a complex128 tensor. The problem lies in the fact that ''y'' tensor
    is a complex64 tensor with no values (empty tensor), whereas ''x'' tensor is a
    complex64 tensor with values. Therefore, the new constraints should not only ensure
    that both tensors have the same datatype, but also that both tensors should have
    values. Here''s the revised constraint:'

- cot: 'The error arises because the input for dynamic binary or n-ary op lowering
    was of a rank greater than 5. What were the arguments? The arguments were tensors
    ''x'' and ''y'' which have a rank of 10. Therefore, we need to correct the Left
    : x.rank and y.rank to be less than or equal to 5. Ops : ''<='', and Right : 5.'

- cot: 'The error is due to the shapes of ''''x'''' and ''''y'''' not being broadcastable
    when performing the power operation. Broadcasting in tensor operations requires
    that the trailing dimensions of the tensors are either 1 or the same. So, the
    constraint should be that for each dimension starting from the last, the size
    of the dimension in ''''x'''' should be equal to the size of the dimension in
    ''''y'''' or one of them should be 1. We start from the last dimension because
    broadcasting aligns dimensions from the end. Therefore, we can revise the constraints
    as follows:'

    int8, int16, int32, int64, complex64, complex128. To solve this, the data type
    of ''x'' and ''y'' should be corrected to match one of the allowed types. This
    can be done using the following constraints:'
