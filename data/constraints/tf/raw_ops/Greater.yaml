- cot: 'The error arises because the function is trying to perform a ''Greater'' operation
    on an int64 tensor and a float tensor. However, both tensors in generated args
    must have the same data type. Let''s see what the args were. the ''x'' tensor
    is int64, but the ''y'' tensor is of type float32. Therefore, Left : y.dtype,
    which is the type of tensor y, should be corrected. It says that should be equal
    to the datatype of tensor x, so Op : ==, and Right : x.dtype.'
  target: 'rror: cannot compute Greater as input #1(zero-based) was expected to be

- cot: 'The error is due to the shapes of ''''x'''' and ''''y'''' not being broadcastable
    for the operation ''Greater''. What the args were? The shape of ''''x'''' is [9,
    8] and the shape of ''''y'''' is [1, 3]. Broadcasting in tensor operations requires
    that the trailing dimensions of the tensors are either 1 or the same. In this
    case, the trailing dimension of ''''x'''' is 8 and the trailing dimension of ''''y''''
    is 3, which are not the same and neither is 1. So, the constraint should be that
    for each dimension starting from the last, the size of the dimension in ''''x''''
    should be equal to the size of the dimension in ''''y'''' or one of them should
    be 1. Therefore, the constraints can be revised as follows:'
