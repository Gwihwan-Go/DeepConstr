- cot: 'It looks like the issue here is with the types of the ''x'' and ''y'' values.
    They are currently Tensors of type ''uint8'', and the error suggests that there''s
    an issue with the ''complex32'' attribute from the tensorflow module. Let''s check
    what the args were. As the ''complex32'' is not supported by tensorflow, the dtype
    of ''x'' and ''y'' should be changed to a supported type such as ''float32'' or
    ''int32''. So, the constraints would be Left : type(x) and type(y). Op : == Right
    : ''float32'' or ''int32'''
  target: 'rror: module ''tensorflow'' has no attribute ''complex32'''
  txt: type(y)=='float32' or type(y)=='int32'
- cot: 'The error is caused because the operation is trying to perform multiplication
    on tensors ''x'' and ''y'' that have ranks greater than 5. Let''s see what the
    ranks were. The ''x'' tensor has a rank of 8 and the ''y'' tensor has a rank of
    10. Therefore, Left : len(x), which is the rank of tensor x, should be corrected.
    Ops : ''<='', and Right : 5. Similarly, for tensor ''y'', Left : len(y), Ops :
    ''<='', and Right : 5.'
  target: 'rror: Input for dynamic binary or n-ary op lowering was of a rank greater
    than 5 [Op:Mul] name:'
  txt: (len(x) <= 5) or (len(y) <= 5)
- cot: 'The error is indicating that the shapes of ''x'' and ''y'' are not broadcastable
    for the multiplication operation. In this case, ''x'' is a tensor of shape [9]
    and ''y'' is a tensor of shape [4]. The broadcasting rules in tensor operations
    require that the trailing dimensions of the tensors should be either 1 or the
    same. Therefore, the constraint should be that for each dimension starting from
    the last, the size of the dimension in ''x'' should be equal to the size of the
    dimension in ''y'' or one of them should be 1. However, here neither of the dimensions
    of ''x'' and ''y'' are 1 and they are not the same either. Hence, the error. Therefore,
    we can revise the constraints as follows:'

    while performing multiplication operation. Tensor ''x'' is of float32 type and
    tensor ''y'' is of float16 type. The operation requires both tensors to be of
    same data type. Let''s see what the args were. Therefore, the constraint should
    be that the data type of tensor ''y'' must be equal to the data type of tensor
    ''x''. The logical constraint will be:'
