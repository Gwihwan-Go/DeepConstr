- cot: 'The error message indicates that the ''axis'' argument to the ''squeeze''
    operation was expected to be a list, but an integer (3) was given instead. This
    means that the type of ''axis'' is incorrect. To resolve this error, we need to
    ensure that ''axis'' is a list. Therefore, Left : axis.dtype, Op : ==, and Right
    : list.'
  target: Expected list for 'axis' argument to 'squeeze' Op, not 3.

- cot: The error is because of the attempt to squeeze a dimension of the tensor that
    does not exist. Here, it tried to squeeze the dimension at index -456 of a tensor
    with 6 dimensions which is invalid. For the squeeze operation to be successful,
    the axis should be a valid index of the input tensor dimensions. Therefore, each
    axis[i] in axis should be a valid dimension (i.e., < input.ndims() and >= -input.ndims()).
    Also, the size of that dimension in the input tensor should be 1. So, input[axis[i]].dim
    should be 1.
