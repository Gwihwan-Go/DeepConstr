- cot: 'The error is triggered because scale is not scalar. Let''s see what the arguments
    were. scale was the tensor of float32. To generate scalar, it should not have
    any dimension. However, scale had 9 dimensions. Therefore, the Left : scale.dim
    should be corrected to scalar float. Ops : ''=='', Right : 0.'
  target: 'scale must be scalar: [7,2,8,2,6,6] [Op:AdjustSaturation] name:'
  txt: scale.dim == 0
- cot: The error is due to the images tensor having less than 3 dimensions. The images
    tensor should have a minimum of 3 dimensions to avoid the error. Therefore, the
    left-hand-side expression is images.dim, the operator is '>=', and the right-hand-side
    expression is 3.
  target: 'input must be at least 3-D, got shape[3] [Op:AdjustSaturation] name:'
  txt: images.dim >= 3
- cot: 'The error is triggered because the input has 8 channels, but it should have
    only 3 channels. Let''s see what the args were. Images were the tensor of float32
    with shape [8, 8, 6, 8]. Therefore, the third dimension of ''images'' should be
    corrected to have 3 channels. So, Left : images.shape[2]. Ops : ''=='', Right
    : 3.'

    it is expected to be either half or float. So, the attribute images.dtype should

    : in, and the Right values are : ["half", "float"].'
