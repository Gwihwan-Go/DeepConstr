- cot: 'The error arises because the function is trying to perform an operation on
    a float tensor and a double tensor. However, both tensors in generated args must
    have the same data type. Let''s see what the args were. The ''a'' tensor is float32,
    but the ''x'' tensor is of type float64. Therefore, Left : type(x), which is the
    type of tensor x, should be corrected. It says that should be equal to the datatype
    of tensor a, so Op : ==, and Right : type(a).'

  txt: type(x)==type(a)
- cot: The error is due to the shapes of 'a' and 'x' being incompatible for the operation
    'IgammaGradA'. The operation requires the shapes of 'a' and 'x' to be compatible,
    which means they must either be the same or be broadcastable. From the given values,
    we can see that the shapes of 'a' and 'x' are [8, 6, 9, 1] and [2, 6, 1, 8] respectively.
    And the incompatible shapes are [6,1,6,6,1,3,4,1,3,2] vs. [6,2,1]. Therefore,
    we need to make sure the dimensions of 'a' and 'x' match these shapes or are broadcastable
    to these shapes.

- cot: 'The error is due to an unsupported broadcasting operation between two tensors
    with different shapes. The broadcasting rules require that the trailing dimensions
    of the tensors should be equal or one of them should be 1 for successful broadcasting.
    Here, the shapes of ''a'' are [1, 6, 1, 2, 6, 1, 6, 6, 4, 3] and ''x'' are [3,
