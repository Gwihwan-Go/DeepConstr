- cot: 'From the error, the attribute ''T'' is given as int32 but it is expected to
    be one of the following types: bfloat16, half, float, double. The tensor ''x''
    is provided as int16, which is not compatible. Thus, the type of ''x'' needs to
    be corrected to match one of the allowed types. So, the constraint would be: type(x)

    the right operand is [''bfloat16'', ''half'', ''float'', ''double''].'
