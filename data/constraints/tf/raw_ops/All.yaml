- cot: 'The error arises because the function is expecting a boolean tensor as input,
    but it is receiving a float tensor. Looking at the inputs provided, ''input''
    is a Tensor of type float32. This should be changed to match the expected type.
    Therefore, the operation is Left : input.dtype, and it needs to be corrected to
    boolean tensor so Op : ==, and Right : bool.'
  target: 'cannot compute All as input #0(zero-based) was expected to be a bool tensor
    but is a float tensor [Op:All] name:'

- cot: 'The error indicates that the reduction operation is trying to be performed
    on dimension 10, but the input tensor only has 4 dimensions. Hence, the maximum
    valid dimension for reduction is 3. The ''axis'' symbol needs to be corrected.
    It is currently [10, 11, 12, 13, 14], but all of these values are greater than
    the maximum valid dimension 3. Therefore, the constraints are that values in ''axis''
    should be less than the rank of ''input''. So Left : axis[i], where i is in range(len(axis)).
    It says that cannot be greater than or equal to 4, so Op : <, and Right : 4.'
  target: Invalid reduction dimension (10 for input with 4 dimension(s) [Op:All]
  txt: (i < input.rank for i in axis)
- cot: 'The error is due to duplicate dimensions in ''axis''. The ''axis'' value contains
    both 9 and -1, which point to the same dimension in the ''input'' tensor (as negative
    indices count from the end). As per the error, duplicate dimensions in ''axis''
    are not allowed. Therefore, the ''axis'' values should be unique. In addition,
    each value in ''axis'' should be less than the rank of ''input''. The rank of
    the ''input'' tensor is 10 (as it has 10 dimensions). Therefore, the Left : axis,
    should not contain duplicate values, so Op : ''not in'', and Right : axis[i+1:].
    Also, each value in ''axis'' should be less than the rank of ''input'', so Op
    : ''<'', and Right : len(input).'
